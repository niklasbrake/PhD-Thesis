abstract = {Recent studies have disclosed several oscillations occurring during resting sleep within the frequency range of the classical delta band (0.5-4 Hz). There are at least 3 oscillations with distinct mechanisms and sites of origin: a slow (<1 Hz) cortically-generated oscillation, a clock-like thalamic oscillation (1,4 Hz), and a cortical oscillation (1-4 Hz). The present paper reviews data on these oscillations and the possible mechanisms which coalesce them into the polymorphic waves of slow wave sleep. Data stem from intracellular (over 500 single cell and 50 double impalemerits) and field potentials recorded from the cortex and thalamus of cats (120 animals) under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia. Other experiments were based on whole night EEG recordings from humans (5 subjects). The frequency of the slow oscillation both in anesthetized animals and in naturally sleeping humans ranged between 0.1 and 1 Hz (89% of the cases being between 0.5 and 0.9 Hz). The slow (< 1 Hz) oscillation is reflected in the EEG as rhythmic sequences of surface-negative waves (associated with hyperpolarizations of deeply- lying neurons) and surface-positive K-complexes (representing excitation in large pools of cortical neurons). Through its long-range synchronization, the slow oscillation has the ability to trigger and to group thalamically- generated spindles and two delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations. Finally, it is argued that the analysis of the electroencephalogram should transcend the spectral analyses, by taking into account the shape of the waves and, when possible, the basic mechanisms that generate those waves.},

@article{Chaudhuri2018,
abstract = {Brain electric field potentials are dominated by an arrhythmic broadband signal, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we propose that broadband power spectra characterize recurrent neural networks of nodes (neurons or clusters of neurons), endowed with an effective balance between excitation and inhibition tuned to keep the network on the edge of dynamical instability. These networks show a fast mode reflecting local dynamics and a slow mode emerging from distributed recurrent connections. Together, the 2 modes produce power spectra similar to those observed in human intracranial EEG (i.e., electrocorticography, ECoG) recordings. Moreover, such networks convert spatial input correlations across nodes into temporal autocorrelation of network activity. Consequently, increased independence between nodes reduces low-frequency power, which may explain changes observed during behavioral tasks. Lastly, varying network coupling causes activity changes that resemble those observed in human ECoG across different arousal states. The model links macroscopic features of empirical ECoG power to a parsimonious underlying network structure, and suggests mechanisms for changes observed across behavioral and arousal states. This work provides a computational framework to generate and test hypotheses about cellular and network mechanisms underlying whole brain electrical dynamics, their variations across states, and potential alterations in brain diseases.},

abstract = {Despite the absence of responsiveness during anesthesia, conscious experience may persist. However, reliable, easily acquirable and interpretable neurophysiological markers of the presence of consciousness in unresponsive states are still missing. A promising marker is based on the decay-rate of the power spectral density (PSD) of the resting EEG. We acquired resting electroencephalogram (EEG) in three groups of healthy participants (n = 5 each), before and during anesthesia induced by either xenon, propofol or ketamine. Dosage of each anesthetic agent was tailored to yield unresponsiveness (Ramsay score = 6). Delayed subjective reports assessed whether conscious experience was present (‘Conscious report') or absent/inaccessible to recall (‘No Report'). We estimated the decay of the PSD of the resting EEG—after removing oscillatory peaks—via the spectral exponent $\beta$, for a broad band (1–40 Hz) and narrower sub-bands (1–20 Hz, 20–40 Hz). Within-subject anesthetic changes in $\beta$ were assessed. Furthermore, based on $\beta$, ‘Conscious report' states were discriminated against ‘no report' states. Finally, we evaluated the correlation of the resting spectral exponent with a recently proposed index of consciousness, the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI), derived from a previous TMS-EEG study. The spectral exponent of the resting EEG discriminated states in which consciousness was present (wakefulness, ketamine) from states where consciousness was reduced or abolished (xenon, propofol). Loss of consciousness substantially decreased the (negative) broad-band spectral exponent in each subject undergoing xenon or propofol anesthesia—indexing an overall steeper PSD decay. Conversely, ketamine displayed an overall PSD decay similar to that of wakefulness—consistent with the preservation of consciousness—yet it showed a flattening of the decay in the high-frequencies (20–40 Hz)—consistent with its specific mechanism of action. The spectral exponent was highly correlated to PCI, corroborating its interpretation as a marker of the presence of consciousness. A steeper PSD of the resting EEG reliably indexed unconsciousness in anesthesia, beyond sheer unresponsiveness.},

abstract = {Electrophysiological signals exhibit both periodic and aperiodic properties. Periodic oscillations have been linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral and disease states. Emerging evidence demonstrates that the aperiodic component has putative physiological interpretations and that it dynamically changes with age, task demands and cognitive states. Electrophysiological neural activity is typically analyzed using canonically defined frequency bands, without consideration of the aperiodic (1/f-like) component. We show that standard analytic approaches can conflate periodic parameters (center frequency, power, bandwidth) with aperiodic ones (offset, exponent), compromising physiological interpretations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an algorithm to parameterize neural power spectra as a combination of an aperiodic component and putative periodic oscillatory peaks. This algorithm requires no a priori specification of frequency bands. We validate this algorithm on simulated data, and demonstrate how it can be used in applications ranging from analyzing age-related changes in working memory to large-scale data exploration and analysis.},

abstract = {Neural circuits sit in a dynamic balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I). Fluctuations in E:I balance have been shown to influence neural computation, working memory, and information flow, while more drastic shifts and aberrant E:I patterns are implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. Current methods for measuring E:I dynamics require invasive procedures that are difficult to perform in behaving animals, and nearly impossible in humans. This has limited the ability to examine the full impact that E:I shifts have in cognition and disease. In this study, we develop a computational model to show that E:I changes can be estimated from the power law exponent (slope) of the electrophysiological power spectrum. Predictions from the model are validated in published data from two species (rats and macaques). We find that reducing E:I ratio via the administration of general anesthetic in macaques results in steeper power spectra, tracking conscious state over time. This causal result is supported by inference from known anatomical E:I changes across the depth of rat hippocampus, as well as oscillatory theta-modulated dynamic shifts in E:I. Our results provide evidence that E:I ratio may be inferred from electrophysiological recordings at many spatial scales, ranging from the local field potential to surface electrocorticography. This simple method for estimating E:I ratio—one that can be applied retrospectively to existing data—removes a major hurdle in understanding a currently difficult to measure, yet fundamental, aspect of neural computation.},

While theoretical accounts predict the emergence of a corresponding hierarchy of neuronal timescales, direct electrophysiological evidence across the human cortex is lacking. Here, we infer neuronal timescales from invasive intracranial recordings. Timescales increase along the principal sensorimotor-to-association axis across the entire human cortex, and scale with single-unit timescales within macaques. Cortex-wide transcriptomic analysis shows direct alignment between timescales and expression of excitation- and inhibition-related genes, as well as genes specific to voltage-gated transmembrane ion transporters. Finally, neuronal timescales are functionally dynamic: prefrontal cortex timescales expand during working memory maintenance and predict individual performance, while cortex-wide timescales compress with aging. Thus, neuronal timescales follow cytoarchitectonic gradients across the human cortex and are relevant for cognition in both short and long terms, bridging microcircuit physiology with macroscale dynamics and behavior.},

abstract = {Significant changes in topographic quantitative EEG (QEEG) features were documented during induction and emergence from anaesthesia induced by the systematic administration of sevoflurane and propofol in combination with remifentanil. The goal was to identify those changes that were sensitive to alterations in the state of consciousness but independent of anaesthetic protocol. Healthy paid volunteers were anaesthetized and reawakened using propofol/remifentanil and sevoflurane/remifentanil, administered in graded steps while the level of arousal was measured. Alterations in the level of arousal were accompanied by significant QEEG changes, many of which were consistent across anaesthetic protocols. Light sedation was accompanied by decreased posterior alpha and increased frontal/central beta power. Frontal power predominance increased with deeper sedation, involving alpha and, to a lesser extent, delta and theta power. With loss of consciousness, delta and theta power increased further in anterior regions and also spread to posterior regions. These changes reversed with return to consciousness.},

abstract = {With rapidly advancing multi-electrode recording technology, the local field potential (LFP) has again become a popular measure of neuronal activity in both research and clinical applications. Proper understanding of the LFP requires detailed mathematical modeling incorporating the anatomical and electrophysiological features of neurons near the recording electrode, as well as synaptic inputs from the entire network. Here we propose a hybrid modeling scheme combining efficient point-neuron network models with biophysical principles underlying LFP generation by real neurons. The LFP predictions rely on populations of network-equivalent multicompartment neuron models with layer-specific synaptic connectivity, can be used with an arbitrary number of point-neuron network populations, and allows for a full separation of simulated network dynamics and LFPs. We apply the scheme to a full-scale cortical network model for a ∼1mm2 patch of primary visual cortex, predict laminar LFPs for different network states, assess the relative LFP contribution from different laminar populations, and investigate effects of input correlations and neuron density on the LFP. The generic nature of the hybrid scheme and its public implementation in hybridLFPy form the basis for LFP predictions from other and larger pointneuron network models, as well as extensions of the current application with additional biological detail.},

A 1/. f-like power spectrum is indicative of arrhythmic brain activity that does not contain a predominant temporal scale (hence, 'scale-free'). This characteristic of scale-free brain activity distinguishes it from brain oscillations. Although scale-free brain activity and brain oscillations coexist, our understanding of the former remains limited. Recent research has shed light on the spatiotemporal organization, functional significance, and potential generative mechanisms of scale-free brain activity, as well as its developmental and clinical relevance. A deeper understanding of this prevalent brain signal should provide new insights into, and analytical tools for, cognitive neuroscience. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

We measured the scalp EEG with a dense electrode (128-channel) montage during the course of light general anaesthesia with xenon and then propofol in normal human subjects. EEG was measured during induction and recovery of general anaesthesia in five normal subjects, and we obtained analysable data from three of these subjects. EEG topographies were plotted on a realistic head surface. Scalp fields were spatially de-blurred using a realistic head model and projected onto an averaged cortical surface Both xenon and propofol elicited large increases in midline frontal theta-band EEG power. Propofol reliably elicited orbitofrontal delta activity. Xenon, but not propofol, caused large increases in delta over the posterior cortex. Increased gamma power was observed for both anaesthetic agents at midline electrodes over the posterior cortex, but not anteriorly. Anaesthesia-induced delta and theta waves were differentially distributed along the anterior-posterior axis of the brain in a manner that corresponds well to the anatomy of putative neuronal generators. The distribution of anaesthetic-induced changes in fast gamma-band power seems to reflect functional differences between the posterior and anterior aspects of the cerebral cortex. These preliminary observations were consistent within our small sample, indicating that larger studies of anaesthetic effects using high-density recordings are warranted.},

abstract = {Variations in cortical oscillations in the alpha (7–14 Hz) and beta (15–29 Hz) range have been correlated with attention, working memory, and stimulus detection. The mu rhythm recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a prominent oscillation generated by Rolandic cortex containing alpha and beta bands. Despite its prominence, the neural mechanisms regulating mu are unknown. We characterized the ongoing MEG mu rhythm from a localized source in the finger representation of primary somatosensory (SI) cortex. Subjects showed variation in the relative expression of mu-alpha or mu-beta, which were nonoverlapping for roughly 50% of their respective durations on single trials. To delineate the origins of this rhythm, a biophysically principled computational neural model of SI was developed, with distinct laminae, inhibitory and excitatory neurons, and feedforward (FF, representative of lemniscal thalamic drive) and feedback (FB, representative of higher-order cortical drive or input from nonlemniscal thalamic nuclei) inputs defined by the laminar location of their postsynaptic effects. The mu-alpha component was accurately modeled by rhythmic FF input at approximately 10-Hz. The mu-beta component was accurately modeled by the addition of approximately 10-Hz FB input that was nearly synchronous with the FF input. The relative dominance of these two frequencies depended on the delay between FF and FB drives, their relative input strengths, and stochastic changes in these variables. The model also reproduced key features of the impact of high prestimulus mu power on peaks in SI-evoked activity. For stimuli presented during high mu power, the model predicted enhancement in an initial evoked peak and decreased subsequent deflections. In agreement, the MEG-evoked responses showed an enhanced initial peak and a trend to smaller subsequent peaks. These data provide new information on the dynamics of the mu rhythm in humans and the model provides a novel mechanistic interpretation of this rhythm and its functional significance.},

Whereas recent studies have begun to outline the spatial organization of synaptic inputs on individual neurons, the underlying principles related to the specific neural functions are not well understood. Here we perform two-photon dendritic imaging with a genetically-encoded glutamate sensor in awake monkeys, and map the excitatory synaptic inputs on dendrites of individual V1 superficial layer neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution. We find a functional integration and trade-off between orientation-selective and color-selective inputs in basal dendrites of individual V1 neurons. Synaptic inputs on dendrites are spatially clustered by stimulus feature, but functionally scattered in multidimensional feature space, providing a potential substrate of local feature integration on dendritic branches. Furthermore, apical dendrite inputs have larger receptive fields and longer response latencies than basal dendrite inputs, suggesting a dominant role for apical dendrites in integrating feedback in visual information processing.},

We found the relative inhibitory input at the apical dendrite's main bifurcation to be more than 2-fold larger for L2 than L3 and L5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells. Towards the distal tuft dendrites in upper L1, the relative inhibitory input was at least about 2-fold larger for L5 pyramidal cells than for all others. Only L3 pyramidal cells showed homogeneous inhibitory input fraction. The inhibitory-to-excitatory synaptic ratio is thus specific for the types of pyramidal cells. Inhibitory axons preferentially innervated either L2 or L3/5 apical dendrites, but not both. These findings describe connectomic principles for the control of pyramidal cells at their apical dendrites and support differential computational properties of L2,L3 and subtypes of L5 pyramidal cells in cortex.},

New analysis methods were used to estimate the frequency and spatial scales of activity in dendritic branches and spines.

abstract = {General anesthetics are thought to act on both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal pathways at both post- and presynaptic sites. However, the literature in these regards is somewhat controversial. The aim of the present study was to reassess the relative importance of the various anesthetic actions using a common preparation. Rat cortical neurons in primary culture were used to record spontaneous miniature postsynaptic currents by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Halothane at clinically relevant concentrations prolonged the decay phase of spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIP-SCs) recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin and at higher concentrations decreased the frequency of mIPSCs. The mIPSC amplitudes underwent little change. Spontaneous action potential-dependent IPSCs recorded in the absence of tetrodotoxin were similarly affected by halothane. Halothane also decreased the frequency of spontaneous miniature non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) as well as spontaneous action potential-dependent NMDA EPSCs and non-NMDA EPSCs without affecting their decay phase. The halothane effect on mIPSC and mEPSC frequency was dependent on the external calcium concentration. In contrast to halothane, the only effect of propofol was the prolongation of the decay phase of mIPSCs and IPSCs. The prolongation of mIPSCs and IPSCs by halothane and propofol coupled with the ineffectiveness on mEPSCs and EPSCs suggests a selective postsynaptic modulation of GABAA receptors. The additional calcium-dependent inhibition of mIPSC and mEPSC frequency by halothane (but not propofol) suggests a more general mechanism by this anesthetic on presynaptic transmitter release.},

This form of supralinearity may represent a general principle for synaptic integration in thin dendrites. However, individual cortical neurons receive many diverse classes of input that may require distinct postsynaptic decoding schemes. Here, we show that sensory, motor, and thalamic inputs preferentially target basal, apical oblique, and distal tuft dendrites, respectively, in layer 5b pyramidal neurons of the mouse retrosplenial cortex, a visuospatial association area. These dendritic compartments exhibited differential expression of NMDA receptor-mediated supralinearity due to systematic changes in the AMPA-to-NMDA receptor ratio. Our results reveal a new schema for integration in cortical pyramidal neurons, in which dendrite-specific changes in synaptic receptors support input-localized decoding. This coexistence of multiple modes of dendritic integration in single neurons has important implications for synaptic plasticity and cortical computation.},

Although rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is also associated with diminished arousal levels, it is characterized by a desynchronized, ‘wake-like' EEG. This observation implies that reduced arousal states are not necessarily only defined by synchronous oscillatory activity. Using intracranial and surface EEG recordings in four independent data sets, we demonstrate that the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, delineates wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, NREM and REM sleep. Critically, the spectral slope discriminates wakefulness from REM sleep solely based on the neurophysiological brain state. Taken together, our findings describe a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including different sleep stages as well as anesthesia in humans.},

abstract = {The neurophysiological mechanisms by which anesthetic drugs cause loss of consciousness are poorly understood. Anesthetic actions at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels have been studied in detail at steady states of deep general anesthesia. However, little is known about how anesthetics alter neural activity during the transition into unconsciousness. We recorded simultaneous multiscale neural activity from human cortex, including ensembles of single neurons, local field potentials, and intracranial electrocorticograms, during induction of general anesthesia. We analyzed local and global neuronal network changes that occurred simultaneously with loss of consciousness. We show that propofol-induced unconsciousness occurs within seconds of the abrupt onset of a slow (<1 Hz) oscillation in the local field potential. This oscillation marks a state in which cortical neurons maintain local patterns of network activity, but this activity is fragmented across both time and space. Local (<4 mm) neuronal populations maintain the millisecond-scale connectivity patterns observed in the awake state, and spike rates fluctuate and can reach baseline levels. However, neuronal spiking occurs only within a limited slow oscillation-phase window and is silent otherwise, fragmenting the time course of neural activity. Unexpectedly, we found that these slow oscillations occur asynchronously across cortex, disrupting functional connectivity between cortical areas. We conclude that the onset of slow oscillations is a neural correlate of propofol-induced loss of consciousness, marking a shift to cortical dynamics in which local neuronal networks remain intact but become functionally isolated in time and space.},

abstract = {The 1/f-like decay observed in the power spectrum of electro-physiological signals, along with scale-free statistics of the so-called neuronal avalanches, constitutes evidence of criticality in neuronal systems. Recent in vitro studies have shown that avalanche dynamics at criticality corresponds to some specific balance of excitation and inhibition, thus suggesting that this is a basic feature of the critical state of neuronal networks. In particular, a lack of inhibition significantly alters the temporal structure of the spontaneous avalanche activity and leads to an anomalous abundance of large avalanches. Here, we study the relationship between network inhibition and the scaling exponent $\beta$ of the power spectral density (PSD) of avalanche activity in a neuronal network model inspired in Self-Organized Criticality. We find that this scaling exponent depends on the percentage of inhibitory synapses and tends to the value $\beta$ = 1 for a percentage of about 30%. More specifically, $\beta$ is close to 2, namely, Brownian noise, for purely excitatory networks and decreases towards values in the interval [1, 1.4] as the percentage of inhibitory synapses ranges between 20% and 30%, in agreement with experimental findings. These results indicate that the level of inhibition affects the frequency spectrum of resting brain activity and suggest the analysis of the PSD scaling behavior as a possible tool to study pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Neurons in the brain are wired into adaptive networks that exhibit collective dynamics as diverse as scale-specific oscillations and scale-free neuronal avalanches. Although existing models account for oscillations and avalanches separately, they typically do not explain both phenomena, are too complex to analyze analytically or intractable to infer from data rigorously. Here we propose a feedback-driven Ising-like class of neural networks that captures avalanches and oscillations simultaneously and quantitatively. In the simplest yet fully microscopic model version, we can analytically compute the phase diagram and make direct contact with human brain resting-state activity recordings via tractable inference of the model's two essential parameters. The inferred model quantitatively captures the dynamics over a broad range of scales, from single sensor oscillations to collective behaviors of extreme events and neuronal avalanches. Importantly, the inferred parameters indicate that the co-existence of scale-specific (oscillations) and scale-free (avalanches) dynamics occurs close to a non-equilibrium critical point at the onset of self-sustained oscillations.},

abstract = {The first recording of the electric field of the human brain was made by the German psychiatrist Hans Berger in 1924 in Jena. He gave this recording the name electroencephalogram (EEG). (Berger, 1929).(From 1929 to 1938 he published 20 scientific papers on the EEG under the same title "{\"{U}}ber das Elektroenkephalogram des Menschen".) 1. spontaneous activity, 2. evoked potentials, and 3. bioelectric events produced by single neurons. Spontaneous activity is measured on the scalp or on the brain and is called the electroencephalogram. The amplitude of the EEG is about 100 ZV when measured on the scalp, and about 1-2 mV when measured on the surface of the brain. The bandwidth of this signal is from under 1 Hz to about 50 Hz, as demonstrated in Figure 13.1. As the phrase "spontaneous activity" implies, this activity goes on continuously in the living individual. Evoked potentials are those components of the EEG that arise in response to a stimulus (which may be electric, auditory, visual, etc.) Such signals are usually below the noise level and thus not readily distinguished, and one must use a train of stimuli and signal averaging to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Single-neuron behavior can be examined through the use of microelectrodes which impale the cells of interest. Through studies of the single cell, one hopes to build models of cell networks that will reflect actual tissue properties.},

abstract = {A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns the relation between the spiking of individual neurons and the aggregate electrical activity of neuronal ensembles as seen in local field potentials (LFPs). Because LFPs reflect both spiking activity and subthreshold events, this question is not simply one of data aggregation. Recording from 20 neurosurgical patients, we directly examined the relation between LFPs and neuronal spiking. Examining 2030 neurons in widespread brain regions, we found that firing rates were positively correlated with broadband (2-150 Hz) shifts in the LFP power spectrum. In contrast, narrowband oscillations correlated both positively and negatively with firing rates at different recording sites. Broadband power shifts were a more reliable predictor of neuronal spiking than narrowband power shifts. These findings suggest that broadband LFP power provides valuable information concerning neuronal activity beyond that contained in narrowband oscillations.

abstract = {Recent studies have identified broadband phenomena in the electric potentials produced by the brain. We report the finding of power-law scaling in these signals using subdural electrocorticographic recordings from the surface of human cortex. The power spectral density (PSD) of the electric potential has the power-law form P(f ) ∼ Af-$\chi$x from 80 to 500 Hz. This scaling index, $\chi$ = 4:0±0:1, is conserved across subjects, area in the cortex, and local neural activity levels. The shape of the PSD does not change with increases in local cortical activity, but the amplitude, A, increases. We observe a "knee" in the spectra at f0 ≃ 75Hz, implying the existence of a characteristic time scale $\tau$ = (2$\pi$f0) -1 ≃ 2 - 4ms. Below f0, we explore two-power-law forms of the PSD, and demonstrate that there are activity-related fluctuations in the amplitude of a power-law process lying beneath the $\alpha$/$\beta$ rhythms. Finally, we illustrate through simulation how, small-scale, simplified neuronal models could lead to these power-law observations. This suggests a new paradigm of non-oscillatory "asynchronous," scalefree, changes in cortical potentials, corresponding to changes in mean population-averaged firing rate, to complement the prevalent "synchronous" rhythm-based paradigm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Miller et al.},

abstract = {Study Objectives: The electrophysiological correlates of anesthetic sedation remain poorly understood. We used high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) and source modeling to investigate the cortical processes underlying propofol anesthesia and compare them to sleep. Design: 256-channel EEG recordings in humans during propofol anesthesia. Setting: Hospital operating room. Patients or Participants: 8 healthy subjects (4 males) Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Initially, propofol induced increases in EEG power from 12-25 Hz. Loss of consciousness (LOC) was accompanied by the appearance of EEG slow waves that resembled the slow waves of NREM sleep. We compared slow waves in propofol to slow waves recorded during natural sleep and found that both populations of waves share similar cortical origins and preferentially propagate along the mesial components of the default network. However, propofol slow waves were spatially blurred compared to sleep slow waves and failed to effectively entrain spindle activity. Propofol also caused an increase in gamma (25-40 Hz) power that persisted throughout LOC. Source modeling analysis showed that this increase in gamma power originated from the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. During LOC, we found increased gamma functional connectivity between these regions compared to the wakefulness. Conclusions: Propofol anesthesia is a sleep-like state and slow waves are associated with diminished consciousness even in the presence of high gamma activity.},

abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are among the most important techniques for non-invasively studying cognition and disease in the human brain. These signals are known to originate from cortical neural activity, typically described in terms of current dipoles. While the link between cortical current dipoles and EEG/MEG signals is relatively well understood, surprisingly little is known about the link between different kinds of neural activity and the current dipoles themselves. Detailed biophysical modeling has played an important role in exploring the neural origin of intracranial electric signals, like extracellular spikes and local field potentials. However, this approach has not yet been taken full advantage of in the context of exploring the neural origin of the cortical current dipoles that are causing EEG/MEG signals. Here, we present a method for reducing arbitrary simulated neural activity to single current dipoles. We find that the method is applicable for calculating extracranial signals, but less suited for calculating intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) signals. We demonstrate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for investigating the neural origin of EEG/MEG signals. This is done through example studies of the single-neuron EEG contribution, the putative EEG contribution from calcium spikes, and from calculating EEG signals from large-scale neural network simulations. We also demonstrate how the simulated current dipoles can be used directly in combination with detailed head models, allowing for simulated EEG signals with an unprecedented level of biophysical details. In conclusion, this paper presents a framework for biophysically detailed modeling of EEG and MEG signals, which can be used to better our understanding of non-inasively measured neural activity in humans.},

abstract = {Propofol (2,6 di-isopropylphenol) is an alkyphenol recently introduced for use as a general anesthetic. The modulation of GABA(A) receptor activation and desensitization by propofol was studied using a rapid perfusion system and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from mouse hippocampal neurons. The effects of concentrations of propofol used clinically on single-channel and synaptic currents were also examined. Propofol evoked current responses (EC50 = 61 $\mu$M) and shifted the dose-response curve of GABA-activated current to the left without altering the maximum of the GABA response. Preincubation with propofol and GABA led to desensitization of the GABA response (EC50 = 454 $\mu$M and 23 $\mu$M, respectively). Saturating concentrations of GABA (600 $\mu$M) evoked currents that peaked and then declined in a biexponential fashion with fast and slow time constants of $\tau$(f) = 1.0 sec and $\tau$(s) = 3.5 sec. Propofol (10 $\mu$M) did not change the amplitude of the peak response but decreased the rates of decay approximately 1.5-fold and enhanced the steady-state current proportionately. Recovery from desensitization was also biexponential ($\tau$(f) = 11 sec, $\tau$(s) = 69 sec) but not influenced by propofol. Single-channel recordings from outside-out patches demonstrated that both propofol and GABA activated channels with a 30 pS and 21 pS open state. Propofol increased the frequency but not the duration or conductance of GABA-activated events. Miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were evoked by the application of hypertonic sucrose to the cell soma. Propofol (2 $\mu$M) prolonged the decay time of mIPSCs to an extent similar to which it increased the open probability of GABA- activated channels (2.3- vs 3-fold). A sequential model, based on a previous scheme of GABA receptor gating (Weiss and Magelby, 1989), is presented to summarize propofol's actions on GABA(A) receptor function. We show through simulation that the model reliably reproduced the whole-cell tracings. Our results indicate that propofol's neurodepressive actions will be associated with enhancement of inhibitory synaptic transmission.},

abstract = {Spontaneous neuronal activity is an important property of the cerebral cortex but its spatiotemporal organization and dynamical framework remain poorly understood. Studies in reduced systems—tissue cultures, acute slices, and anesthetized rats—show that spontaneous activity forms characteristic clusters in space and time, called neuronal avalanches. Modeling studies suggest that networks with this property are poised at a critical state that optimizes input processing, information storage, and transfer, but the relevance of avalanches for fully functional cerebral systems has been controversial. Here we show that ongoing cortical synchronization in awake rhesus monkeys carries the signature of neuronal avalanches. Negative LFP deflections (nLFPs) correlate with neuronal spiking and increase in amplitude with increases in local population spike rate and synchrony. These nLFPs form neuronal avalanches that are scale-invariant in space and time and with respect to the threshold of nLFP detection. This dimension, threshold invariance, describes a fractal organization: smaller nLFPs are embedded in clusters of larger ones without destroying the spatial and temporal scale-invariance of the dynamics. These findings suggest an organization of ongoing cortical synchronization that is scale-invariant in its three fundamental dimensions—time, space, and local neuronal group size. Such scale-invariance has ontogenetic and phylogenetic implications because it allows large increases in network capacity without a fundamental reorganization of the system.},

abstract = {Unconsciousness is a fundamental component of general anesthesia (GA), but anesthesiologists have no reliable ways to be certain that a patient is unconscious. To develop EEG signatures that track loss and recovery of consciousness under GA, we recorded highdensity EEGs in humans during gradual induction of and emergence from unconsciousness with propofol. The subjects executed an auditory task at 4-s intervals consisting of interleaved verbal and click stimuli to identify loss and recovery of consciousness. During induction, subjects lost responsiveness to the less salient clicks before losing responsiveness to the more salient verbal stimuli; during emergence they recovered responsiveness to the verbal stimuli before recovering responsiveness to the clicks. The median frequency and bandwidth of the frontal EEG power tracked the probability of response to the verbal stimuli during the transitions in consciousness. Loss of consciousness was marked simultaneously by an increase in low-frequency EEG power (<1Hz), the loss of spatially coherent occipital alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz), and the appearance of spatially coherent frontal alpha oscillations. These dynamics reversed with recovery of consciousness. The low-frequency phase modulated alpha amplitude in two distinct patterns. During profound unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency peaks, whereas during the transition into and out of unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency nadirs. This latter phase-amplitude relationship predicted recovery of consciousness. Our results provide insights into themechanisms of propofol-induced unconsciousness, establish EEG signatures of this brain state that track transitions in consciousness precisely, and suggest strategies for monitoring the brain activity of patients receiving GA.},

abstract = {5th ed. This edition presents invasive depth EEG techniques, in four rather that two chapters. The section on evoked potentials has been enlarged with the addition of chapters on neurometric analysis and P300 response. The section on computerized EEG analysis has grown to four chapters and includes not only the principles but the clinical use of EEG topography. A new chapter presenting the principles of computerized epilepsy monitoring also includes the foundations of digitized (paperless) EEG recording. A special MEG chapter addresses the importance of magnetoencephalography at both the fundamental and clinical level. 1. Historical aspects / Ernst Niedermeyer -- 2.

abstract = {Ongoing oscillations and evoked responses are two main types of neuronal activity obtained with diverse electrophysiological recordings (EEG/MEG/iEEG/LFP). Although typically studied separately, they might in fact be closely related. One possibility to unite them is to demonstrate that neuronal oscillations have non-zero mean which predicts that stimulus- or task-triggered amplitude modulation of oscillations can contribute to the generation of evoked responses. We validated this mechanism using computational modelling and analysis of a large EEG data set. With a biophysical model, we indeed demonstrated that intracellular currents in the neuron are asymmetric and, consequently, the mean of alpha oscillations is non-zero. To understand the effect that neuronal currents exert on oscillatory mean, we varied several biophysical and morphological properties of neurons in the network, such as voltage-gated channel densities, length of dendrites, and intensity of incoming stimuli. For a very large range of model parameters, we observed evidence for non-zero mean of oscillations. Complimentary, we analysed empirical rest EEG recordings of 90 participants (50 young, 40 elderly) and, with spatio-spectral decomposition, detected at least one spatially-filtred oscillatory component of non-zero mean alpha oscillations in 93% of participants. In order to explain a complex relationship between the dynamics of amplitude-envelope and corresponding baseline shifts, we performed additional simulations with simple oscillators coupled with different time delays. We demonstrated that the extent of spatial synchronisation may obscure macroscopic estimation of alpha rhythm modulation while leaving baseline shifts unchanged. Overall, our results predict that amplitude modulation of neural oscillations should at least partially explain the generation of evoked responses. Therefore, inference about changes in evoked responses with respect to cognitive conditions, age or neuropathologies should be constructed while taking into account oscillatory neuronal dynamics.},

abstract = {Cortical surface recording techniques such as EEG and ECoG are widely used for measuring brain activity. The prevailing assumption is that surface potentials primarily reflect synaptic activity, although non-synaptic events may also contribute. Here we show that dendritic calcium spikes occurring in pyramidal neurons (that we showed previously are cognitively relevant) are clearly detectable in cortical surface potentials. To show this we developed an optogenetic, non-synaptic approach to evoke dendritic calcium spikes in vivo. We found that optogenetically evoked calcium spikes were easily detectable and had an unexpected waveform near the cortical surface. Sensory-evoked dendritic calcium spikes were also clearly detectable with amplitudes that matched the contribution of synaptic input. These results reveal how dendritic calcium spikes appear at the cortical surface and their significant impact on surface potentials, suggesting that long-standing surface recording data may contain information about dendritic activity that is relevant to behavior and cognitive function.},

abstract = {What changes in the brain when we lose consciousness? One possibility is that the loss of consciousness corresponds to a transition of the brain's electric activity away from edge-of-chaos criticality, or the knife's edge in between stability and chaos. Recent mathematical developments have produced tools for testing this hypothesis, which we apply to cortical recordings from diverse brain states. We show that the electric activity of the cortex is indeed poised near the boundary between stability and chaos during conscious states and transitions away from this boundary during unconsciousness and that this transition disrupts cortical information processing.},

abstract = {Large amplitude slow waves are characteristic for the summary brain activity, recorded as electroencephalogram (EEG) or local field potentials (LFP), during deep stages of sleep and some types of anesthesia. Slow rhythm of the synchronized EEG reflects an alternation of active (depolarized, UP) and silent (hyperpolarized, DOWN) states of neocortical neurons. In neurons, involvement in the generalized slow oscillation results in a long-range synchronization of changes of their membrane potential as well as their firing. Here, we aimed at intracellular analysis of details of this synchronization. We asked which components of neuronal activity exhibit long-range correlations during the synchronized EEG? To answer this question, we made simultaneous intracellular recordings from two to four neocortical neurons in cat neocortex. We studied how correlated is the occurrence of active and silent states, and how correlated are fluctuations of the membrane potential in pairs of neurons located close one to the other or separated by up to 13. mm. We show that strong long-range correlation of the membrane potential was observed only (i) during the slow oscillation but not during periods without the oscillation, (ii) during periods which included transitions between the states but not during within-the-state periods, and (iii) for the low-frequency (< 5 Hz) components of membrane potential fluctuations but not for the higher-frequency components (> 10 Hz). In contrast to the neurons located several millimeters one from the other, membrane potential fluctuations in neighboring neurons remain strongly correlated during periods without slow oscillation. We conclude that membrane potential correlation in distant neurons is brought about by synchronous transitions between the states, while activity within the states is largely uncorrelated. The lack of the generalized fine-scale synchronization of membrane potential changes in neurons during the active states of slow oscillation may allow individual neurons to selectively engage in short living episodes of correlated activity-a process that may be similar to dynamical formation of neuronal ensembles during activated brain states. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aging is associated with performance decrements across multiple cognitive domains. The neural noise hypothesis, a dominant view of the basis of this decline, posits that aging is accompanied by an increase in spontaneous, noisy baseline neural activity. Here we analyze data from two different groups of human subjects: intracranial electrocorticography from 15 participants over a 38 year age range (15–53 years) and scalp EEG data from healthy younger (20–30 years) and older (60–70 years) adults to test the neural noise hypothesis from a 1/f noise perspective. Many natural phenomena, including electrophysiology, are characterized by 1/f noise. The defining characteristic of 1/f is that the power of the signal frequency content decreases rapidly as a function of the frequency (f) itself. The slope of this decay, the noise exponent ($\chi$), is often <-1 for electrophysiological data and has been shown to approach white noise (defined as $\chi$=0) with increasing task difficulty. We observed, in both electrophysiological datasets, that aging is associated with a flatter (more noisy) 1/f power spectral density, even at rest, and that visual cortical 1/f noise statistically mediates age-related impairments in visual working memory. These results provide electrophysiological support for the neural noise hypothesis of aging.},

abstract = {1. General anaesthetic agents prevent awareness of sensory input and subsequent recall of sensory events after administration. The mechanisms involved in higher sensory processing, including awareness and recall, are not fully elucidated. However, fast oscillations in neuronal activity in the 20-80 Hz (gamma) range have been strongly implicated. Here we have investigated the effects of two anaesthetic agents and a sedative/hypnotic drug on these oscillations. 2. Trains of fast oscillations, shown previously to be shaped by $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor activation, were evoked by pressure ejection of L-glutamate (10 mM) onto the perisomatic region of hippocampal area CA1 in the presence of 3-((R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (RCPP), 50 $\mu$M, 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[flquinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX), 50 $\mu$M and 2-hydroxysaclofen, 0.2 mM. 3. Thiopentone (10-200 $\mu$M) and propofol (0.5-10 $\mu$M) dose-dependently decreased both the maximum oscillation frequency, by approx. 90%, and the incidence of evoked rhythmic oscillations by approx. 60%. Diazepam (0.05 - 1 $\mu$M) decreased maximum oscillation frequency by about 40% but did not affect the incidence of evoked oscillations. 4. The similar effects of thiopentone and propofol were mediated by both a large (about 600%) increase in the decay constant ($\tau$(D)) of GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (i.p.s.cs) and a bicuculline-sensitive leak current. The two drugs had differing effects on i.p.s.c. amplitude. Diazepam caused a small increase in $\tau$(D) (about 170%) and did not alter leak currents at the doses used. 5. Effects of the anaesthetic agents were seen on the above measurements at similar concentrations to those estimated in the CNS during clinical and veterinary anaesthesia. We suggest that the effects on fast oscillations associated with cognition may contribute to the mechanism by which these agents produce general anaesthesia.},

abstract = {Knowledge about the collective dynamics of cortical spiking is very informative about the underlying coding principles. However, even most basic properties are not known with certainty, because their assessment is hampered by spatial subsampling, i.e., the limitation that only a tiny fraction of all neurons can be recorded simultaneously with millisecond precision. Building on a novel, subsampling-invariant estimator, we fit and carefully validate a minimal model for cortical spike propagation. The model interpolates between two prominent states: asynchronous and critical. We find neither of them in cortical spike recordings across various species, but instead identify a narrow reverberating regime. This approach enables us to predict yet unknown properties from very short recordings and for every circuit individually, including responses to minimal perturbations, intrinsic network timescales, and the strength of external input compared to recurrent activation thereby informing about the underlying coding principles for each circuit, area, state and task.},

They are usually estimated by fitting the exponential decay of data autocorrelation in the time or frequency domain. Here we show that this standard procedure often fails to recover the correct timescales due to a statistical bias arising from the finite sample size. We develop an alternative approach to estimate timescales by fitting the sample autocorrelation or power spectrum with a generative model based on a mixture of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes using adaptive approximate Bayesian computations. Our method accounts for finite sample size and noise in data and returns a posterior distribution of timescales that quantifies the estimation uncertainty and can be used for model selection. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method on synthetic data and illustrate its application to recordings from the primate cortex. We provide a customizable Python package that implements our framework via different generative models suitable for diverse applications.},
