abstract = {In this viewpoint article, we discuss the electric properties of the medium around neurons, which are important to correctly interpret extracellular potentials or electric field effects in neural tissue. We focus on how these electric properties shape the frequency scaling of brain signals at different scales, such as intracellular recordings, the local field potential (LFP), the electroencephalogram (EEG) or the magnetoencephalogram (MEG). These signals display frequency-scaling properties which are not consistent with resistive media. The medium appears to exert a frequency filtering scaling as 1/?f, which is the typical frequency scaling of ionic diffusion. Such a scaling was also found recently by impedance measurements in physiological conditions. Ionic diffusion appears to be the only possible explanation to reconcile these measurements and the frequency-scaling properties found in different brain signals. However, other measurements suggest that the extracellular medium is essentially resistive. To resolve this discrepancy, we show new evidence that metal-electrode measurements can be perturbed by shunt currents going through the surface of the brain. Such a shunt may explain the contradictory measurements, and together with ionic diffusion, provides a framework where all observations can be reconciled. Finally, we propose a method to perform measurements avoiding shunting effects, thus enabling to test the predictions of this framework.},

Current, at higher densities that occur in human cranium, was applied and withdrawn over the top and bottom surfaces of each sample and potential drop across different layers was measured. We used a model that considers variations in skull thicknesses to determine the conductivity of the tri-layer skull and its individual anatomical structures. The results indicate that the conductivities of the spongiform (16.2-41.1 milliS/m), the top compact (5.4-7.2 milliS/m) and lower compact (2.8-10.2 milliS/m) layers of the skull have significantly different and inhomogeneous conductivities. The conductivities of the skull layers are frequency dependent in the 10-90 Hz region and are non-ohmic in the 0.45-2.07 A/m2 region. These current densities are much higher than those occurring in human brain.},

Large amplitude activity with maximum power between 15 and 30 c/sec can be often observed on the subdural electrodes together with smaller amplitude lower frequencies, whereas on the scalp only a small part of this high frequency activity is seen and the lower frequencies dominate. The impedance between cortex and scalp has been shown to be similar for low and high EEG frequencies and the high attenuation of the $\beta$ activity at scalp electrodes is believed to be due to summation of polyphasic cortical activity across a limited cortical area (spatial average) is similar to the activity of a non-recursive filter between cortex and scalp and has a low pass characteristic. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

abstract = {To combine insights obtained from electric field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal spiking activity (MUA) we need a better understanding of the relative spatial summation of these indices of neuronal activity. Compared to MUA, the LFP has greater spatial coherence, resulting in lower spatial specificity and lower stimulus selectivity. A differential propagation of low- and high-frequency electric signals supposedly underlies this phenomenon, which could result from cortical tissue specifically attenuating higher frequencies, i.e., from a frequency-dependent impedance spectrum. Here we directly measure the cortical impedance spectrum in vivo in monkey primary visual cortex. Our results show that impedance is independent of frequency, is homogeneous and tangentially isotropic within gray matter, and can be theoretically predicted assuming a pure-resistive conductor. We propose that the spatial summation of LFP and MUA is determined by the size of these signals' generators and the nature of neural events underlying them, rather than by biophysical properties of gray matter. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Electrical measurements of large-scale brain dynamics, termed field potentials, are especially important to understanding and treating the human brain. Here, our goal is to provide best practices on how field potential recordings (electroencephalograms, magnetoencephalograms, electrocorticograms and local field potentials) can be analyzed to identify large-scale brain dynamics, and to highlight critical issues and limitations of interpretation in current work. We focus our discussion of analyses around the broad themes of activation, correlation, communication and coding. We provide recommendations for interpreting the data using forward and inverse models. The forward model describes how field potentials are generated by the activity of populations of neurons. The inverse model describes how to infer the activity of populations of neurons from field potential recordings. A recurring theme is the challenge of understanding how field potentials reflect neuronal population activity given the complexity of the underlying brain systems.},

abstract = {Local field potentials (LFPs) are routinely measured experimentally in brain tissue, and exhibit strong low-pass frequency filtering properties, with high frequencies (such as action potentials) being visible only at very short distances (10 $\mu$m) from the recording electrode. Understanding this filtering is crucial to relate LFP signals with neuronal activity, but not much is known about the exact mechanisms underlying this low-pass filtering. In this paper, we investigate a possible biophysical mechanism for the low-pass filtering properties of LFPs. We investigate the propagation of electric fields and its frequency dependence close to the current source, i.e., at length scales in the order of average interneuronal distances. We take into account the presence of a high density of cellular membranes around current sources, such as glial cells. By considering them as passive cells, we show that under the influence of the electric source field, they respond by polarization. Because of the finite velocity of ionic charge movements, this polarization will not be instantaneous. Consequently, the induced electric field will be frequency-dependent, and much reduced for high frequencies. Our model establishes that this situation is analogous to an equivalent RC circuit, or better yet a system of coupled RC circuits. We present a number of numerical simulations of an induced electric field for biologically realistic values of parameters, and show the frequency filtering effect as well as the attenuation of extracellular potentials with distance. We suggest that induced electric fields in passive cells surrounding neurons are the physical origin of frequency filtering properties of LFPs. Experimentally testable predictions are provided allowing us to verify the validity of this model. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

Although rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is also associated with diminished arousal levels, it is characterized by a desynchronized, ‘wake-like' EEG. This observation implies that reduced arousal states are not necessarily only defined by synchronous oscillatory activity. Using intracranial and surface EEG recordings in four independent data sets, we demonstrate that the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, delineates wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, NREM and REM sleep. Critically, the spectral slope discriminates wakefulness from REM sleep solely based on the neurophysiological brain state. Taken together, our findings describe a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including different sleep stages as well as anesthesia in humans.},

abstract = {Despite the absence of responsiveness during anesthesia, conscious experience may  persist. However, reliable, easily acquirable and interpretable neurophysiological markers of the presence of consciousness in unresponsive states are still missing. A promising marker is based on the decay-rate of the power spectral density (PSD) of the resting EEG. We acquired resting electroencephalogram (EEG) in three groups of healthy participants (n = 5 each), before and during anesthesia induced by either xenon, propofol or ketamine. Dosage of each anesthetic agent was tailored to yield unresponsiveness (Ramsay score = 6). Delayed subjective reports assessed whether conscious experience was present ('Conscious report') or absent/inaccessible to recall ('No Report'). We estimated the decay of the PSD of the resting EEG-after removing oscillatory peaks-via the spectral exponent $\beta$, for a broad band (1-40 Hz) and narrower sub-bands (1-20 Hz, 20-40 Hz). Within-subject anesthetic changes in $\beta$ were assessed. Furthermore, based on $\beta$, 'Conscious report' states were discriminated against 'no report' states. Finally, we evaluated the correlation of the resting spectral exponent with a recently proposed index of consciousness, the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI), derived from a previous TMS-EEG study. The spectral exponent of the resting EEG discriminated states in which consciousness was present (wakefulness, ketamine) from states where consciousness was reduced or abolished (xenon, propofol). Loss of consciousness substantially decreased the (negative) broad-band spectral exponent in each subject undergoing xenon or propofol anesthesia-indexing an overall steeper PSD decay. Conversely, ketamine displayed an overall PSD decay similar to that of wakefulness-consistent with the preservation of consciousness-yet it showed a flattening of the decay in the high-frequencies (20-40 Hz)-consistent with its specific mechanism of action. The spectral exponent was highly correlated to PCI, corroborating its interpretation as a marker of the presence of consciousness. A steeper PSD of the resting EEG reliably indexed unconsciousness in anesthesia, beyond sheer unresponsiveness.},

Building on a novel, subsampling-invariant estimator, we fit and carefully validate a minimal model for cortical spike propagation. The model interpolates between two prominent states: asynchronous and critical. We find neither of them in cortical spike recordings across various species, but instead identify a narrow “reverberating” regime. This approach enables us to predict yet unknown properties from very short recordings and for every circuit individually, including responses to minimal perturbations, intrinsic network timescales, and the strength of external input compared to recurrent activation “thereby informing about the underlying coding principles for each circuit, area, state and task.},

In neuroscience, recordings are strongly limited by subsampling. Here, the subsampling-invariant estimator allows to revisit two prominent hypotheses about the brain's collective spiking dynamics: asynchronous-irregular or critical. We identify consistently for rat, cat, and monkey a state that combines features of both and allows input to reverberate in the network for hundreds of milliseconds.

abstract = {The 1/f-like decay observed in the power spectrum of electro-physiological signals, along with scale-free statistics of the so-called neuronal avalanches, constitutes evidence of criticality in neuronal systems. Recent in vitro studies have shown that avalanche dynamics at criticality corresponds to some specific balance of excitation and inhibition, thus suggesting that this is a basic feature of the critical state of neuronal networks. In particular, a lack of inhibition significantly alters the temporal structure of the spontaneous avalanche activity and leads to an anomalous abundance of large avalanches. Here, we study the relationship between network inhibition and the scaling exponent $\beta$ of the power spectral density (PSD) of avalanche activity in a neuronal network model inspired in Self-Organized Criticality. We find that this scaling exponent depends on the percentage of inhibitory synapses and tends to the value $\beta$ = 1 for a percentage of about 30%. More specifically, $\beta$ is close to 2, namely, Brownian noise, for purely excitatory networks and decreases towards values in the interval [1, 1.4] as the percentage of inhibitory synapses ranges between 20% and 30%, in agreement with experimental findings. These results indicate that the level of inhibition affects the frequency spectrum of resting brain activity and suggest the analysis of the PSD scaling behavior as a possible tool to study pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Author Summary The recurrent interactions among cortical neurons shape the representation of incoming information but the principles governing their evolution are yet unclear. We investigate the computational role of recurrent connections in the context of sensory processing. Specifically, we study a neuronal network model in which the recurrent connections evolve to optimize the information representation of the network. Interestingly, these networks tend to operate near a "critical" point in their dynamics, namely close to a phase of "hallucinations", in which non-trivial spontaneous patterns of activity evolve even without structured input. We provide insights into this behavior by applying the framework to a network of orientation selective neurons, modeling a processing unit in the primary visual cortex. Various scenarios, such as attenuation of the external inputs or increased plasticity, can lead such networks to cross the border into the supercritical phase, which may manifest as neurological and neuropsychiatric phenomena.},

abstract = {Spontaneous fluctuations in neuronal activity emerge at many spatial and temporal scales in cortex. Population measures found these fluctuations to organize as scale-invariant neuronal avalanches, suggesting cortical dynamics to be critical. Macroscopic dynamics, though, depend on physiological states and are ambiguous as to their cellular composition, spatiotemporal origin, and contributions from synaptic input or action potential (AP) output. Here, we study spontaneous firing in pyramidal neurons (PNs) from rat superficial cortical layers in vivo and in vitro using 2-photon imaging. As the animal transitions from the anesthetized to awake state, spontaneous single neuron firing increases in irregularity and assembles into scale-invariant avalanches at the group level. In vitro spike avalanches emerged naturally yet required balanced excitation and inhibition. This demonstrates that neuronal avalanches are linked to the global physiological state of wakefulness and that cortical resting activity organizes as avalanches from firing of local PN groups to global population activity.},

abstract = {Complex cognitive processes require neuronal activity to be coordinated across multiple scales, ranging from local microcircuits to cortex-wide networks. However, multiscale cortical dynamics are not well understood because few experimental approaches have provided sufficient support for hypotheses involving multiscale interactions. To address these limitations, we used, in experiments involving mice, genetically encoded voltage indicator imaging, which measures cortex-wide electrical activity at high spatiotemporal resolution. Here we show that, as mice recovered from anesthesia, scale-invariant spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity gradually emerge. We show for the first time that this scale-invariant activity spans four orders of magnitude in awake mice. In contrast, we found that the cortical dynamics of anesthetized mice were not scale invariant. Our results bridge empirical evidence from disparate scales and support theoretical predictions that the awake cortex operates in a dynamical regime known as criticality. The criticality hypothesis predicts that small-scale cortical dynamics are governed by the same principles as those governing larger-scale dynamics. Importantly, these scale-invariant principles also optimize certain aspects of information processing. Our results suggest that during the emergence from anesthesia, criticality arises as information processing demands increase. We expect that, as measurement tools advance toward larger scales and greater resolution, the multiscale framework offered by criticality will continue to provide quantitative predictions and insight on how neurons, microcircuits, and large-scale networks are dynamically coordinated in the brain.},

The ability to summarize observations using explanatory and predictive theories is the greatest strength of modern science. A theoretical framework is perceived as particularly successful if it can explain very disparate facts. The observation that some apparently complex phenomena can exhibit startling similarities to dynamics generated with simple mathematical models (1) has led to empirical searches for fundamental laws by inspecting data for qualitative agreement with the behavior of such models. A striking feature that has attracted considerable attention is the apparent ubiquity of power-law relationships in empirical data. However, although power laws have been reported in areas ranging from finance and molecular biology to geophysics and the Internet, the data are typically insufficient and the mechanistic insights are almost always too limited for the identification of power-law behavior to be scientifically useful (see the figure). Indeed, even most statistically ?successful? calculations of power laws offer little more than anecdotal value.},

(p. 344) review how previously isolated lines of work can be connected, conclude that many critical transitions (such as escape from the poverty trap) can have positive outcomes, and highlight how the new approaches to sensing fragility can help to detect both risks and opportunities for desired change. Tipping points in complex systems may imply risks of unwanted collapse, but also opportunities for positive change. Our capacity to navigate such risks and opportunities can be boosted by combining emerging insights from two unconnected fields of research. One line of work is revealing fundamental architectural features that may cause ecological networks, financial markets, and other complex systems to have tipping points. Another field of research is uncovering generic empirical indicators of the proximity to such critical thresholds. Although sudden shifts in complex systems will inevitably continue to surprise us, work at the crossroads of these emerging fields offers new approaches for anticipating critical transitions.},

In neural systems, scale-free activity is often neglected in electrophysiological research. Here, we investigate scale-free dynamics in human brain and show that it contains extensive nested frequencies, with the phase of lower frequencies modulating the amplitude of higher frequencies in an upward progression across the frequency spectrum. The functional significance of scale-free brain activity is indicated by task performance modulation and regional variation, with beta being larger in default network and visual cortex and smaller in hippocampus and cerebellum. The precise patterns of nested frequencies in the brain differ from other scale-free dynamics in nature, such as earth seismic waves and stock market fluctuations, suggesting system-specific generative mechanisms. Our findings reveal robust temporal structures and behavioral significance of scale-free brain activity and should motivate future study on its physiological mechanisms and cognitive implications.},

abstract = {The resistive or non-resistive nature of the extracellular space in the brain is still debated, and is an important issue for correctly modeling extracellular potentials. Here, we first show theoretically that if the medium is resistive, the frequency scaling should be the same for electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals at low frequencies (<10 Hz). To test this prediction, we analyzed the spectrum of simultaneous EEG and MEG measurements in four human subjects. The frequency scaling of EEG displays coherent variations across the brain, in general between 1/f and 1/f2, and tends to be smaller in parietal/temporal regions. In a given region, although the variability of the frequency scaling exponent was higher for MEG compared to EEG, both signals consistently scale with a different exponent. In some cases, the scaling was similar, but only when the signal-to-noise ratio of the MEG was low. Several methods of noise correction for environmental and instrumental noise were tested, and they all increased the difference between EEG and MEG scaling. In conclusion, there is a significant difference in frequency scaling between EEG and MEG, which can be explained if the extracellular medium (including other layers such as dura matter and skull) is globally non-resistive.},

abstract = {Many systems in nature are characterized by complex behaviour where large cascades of events, or avalanches, unpredictably alternate with periods of little activity. Snow avalanches are an example. Often the size distribution f(s) of a system's avalanches follows a power law, and the branching parameter sigma, the average number of events triggered by a single preceding event, is unity. A power law for f(s), and sigma = 1, are hallmark features of self-organized critical (SOC) systems, and both have been found for neuronal activity in vitro. Therefore, and since SOC systems and neuronal activity both show large variability, long-term stability and memory capabilities, SOC has been proposed to govern neuronal dynamics in vivo. Testing this hypothesis is difficult because neuronal activity is spatially or temporally subsampled, while theories of SOC systems assume full sampling. To close this gap, we investigated how subsampling affects f(s) and sigma by imposing subsampling on three different SOC models. We then compared f(s) and sigma of the subsampled models with those of multielectrode local field potential (LFP) activity recorded in three macaque monkeys performing a short term memory task.},

abstract = {Spontaneous neuronal activity is an important property of the cerebral cortex but its spatiotemporal organization and dynamical framework remain poorly understood. Studies in reduced systems—tissue cultures, acute slices, and anesthetized rats—show that spontaneous activity forms characteristic clusters in space and time, called neuronal avalanches. Modeling studies suggest that networks with this property are poised at a critical state that optimizes input processing, information storage, and transfer, but the relevance of avalanches for fully functional cerebral systems has been controversial. Here we show that ongoing cortical synchronization in awake rhesus monkeys carries the signature of neuronal avalanches. Negative LFP deflections (nLFPs) correlate with neuronal spiking and increase in amplitude with increases in local population spike rate and synchrony. These nLFPs form neuronal avalanches that are scale-invariant in space and time and with respect to the threshold of nLFP detection. This dimension, threshold invariance, describes a fractal organization: smaller nLFPs are embedded in clusters of larger ones without destroying the spatial and temporal scale-invariance of the dynamics. These findings suggest an organization of ongoing cortical synchronization that is scale-invariant in its three fundamental dimensions—time, space, and local neuronal group size. Such scale-invariance has ontogenetic and phylogenetic implications because it allows large increases in network capacity without a fundamental reorganization of the system.},

abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution?the part of the distribution representing large but rare events?and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov?Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

The concept asserts that a system self-organizes into a critical state where system observables are distributed according to a power law. Prominent examples of self-organized critical dynamics include piling of granular media2, plate tectonics3 and stick–slip motion4. Critical behaviour has been shown to bring about optimal computational capabilities5, optimal transmission6, storage of information7 and sensitivity to sensory stimuli8,9,10. In neuronal systems, the existence of critical avalanches was predicted11 and later observed experimentally6,12,13. However, whereas in the experiments generic critical avalanches were found, in the model of ref. 11 they only show up if the set of parameters is fine-tuned externally to a critical transition state. Here, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that by assuming (biologically more realistic) dynamical synapses14 in a spiking neural network, the neuronal avalanches turn from an exceptional phenomenon into a typical and robust self-organized critical behaviour, if the total resources of neurotransmitter are sufficiently large.},

Our results are compatible with the essential role of gap junctions in olfactory glomeruli and retinal ganglionar cell output. Synchronization and global oscillations also emerge from the network dynamics.

This report aims at clarifying this by measuring D2 and analysing the non-linear nature of EEG through the method of surrogate data as well as by calculating the fractal exponent ($\beta$) via coarse graining spectral analysis (CGSA) in nine adult subjects during waking and sleep states. The results show that even if it is possible to get an estimation of D2 in all states, non-linear structure appears to be present only during slow wave sleep (SWS). EEG exhibits random fractal structure with 1/f−$\beta$ spectrum (1<$\beta$<3) and a negative linear correlation between D2 and $\beta$ in all states except during SWS. In consequence, in those states, finite D2 values could be attributed to the fractal nature of EEG and not to the presence of low-dimensional chaos, and therefore, it the use of $\beta$ would be more appropriate to describe the complexity of EEG, due to its lower computational cost.},

abstract = {The EEG signal is generated by electrical brain cell activity, often described in terms of current dipoles. By applying EEG forward models we can compute the contribution from such dipoles to the electrical potential recorded by EEG electrodes. Forward models are key both for generating understanding and intuition about the neural origin of EEG signals as well as inverse modeling, i.e., the estimation of the underlying dipole sources from recorded EEG signals. Different models of varying complexity and biological detail are used in the field. One such analytical model is the four-sphere model which assumes a four-layered spherical head where the layers represent brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), skull, and scalp, respectively. While conceptually clear, the mathematical expression for the electric potentials in the four-sphere model is cumbersome, and we observed that the formulas presented in the literature contain errors. Here, we derive and present the correct analytical formulas with a detailed derivation. A useful application of the analytical four-sphere model is that it can serve as ground truth to test the accuracy of numerical schemes such as the Finite Element Method (FEM). We performed FEM simulations of the four-sphere head model and showed that they were consistent with the corrected analytical formulas. For future reference we provide scripts for computing EEG potentials with the four-sphere model, both by means of the correct analytical formulas and numerical FEM simulations.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: With the advent of noninvasive neuroimaging, a plethora of digital human  neuroanatomical atlases has been developed. The accuracy of these atlases is constrained by the resolution and signal-gathering powers of available imaging equipment. In an attempt to circumvent these limitations and to produce a high resolution in vivo human neuroanatomy, we investigated the usefulness of intrasubject registration for post hoc MR signal averaging. METHOD: Twenty-seven high resolution (7 x 0.78 and 20 x 1.0 mm3) T1-weighted volumes were acquired from a single subject, along with 12 double echo T2/proton density-weighted volumes. These volumes were automatically registered to a common stereotaxic space in which they were subsampled and intensity averaged. The resulting images were examined for anatomical quality and usefulness for other analytical techniques. RESULTS: The quality of the resulting image from the combination of as few as five T1 volumes was visibly enhanced. The signal-to-noise ratio was expected to increase as the root of the number of contributing scans to 5.2, n = 27. The improvement in the n = 27 average was great enough that fine anatomical details, such as thalamic subnuclei and the gray bridges between the caudate and putamen, became crisply defined. The gray/white matter boundaries were also enhanced, as was the visibility of any finer structure that was surrounded by tissue of varying T1 intensity. The T2 and proton density average images were also of higher quality than single scans, but the improvement was not as dramatic as that of the T1 volumes. CONCLUSION: Overall, the enhanced signal in the averaged images resulted in higher quality anatomical images, and the data lent themselves to several postprocessing techniques. The high quality of the enhanced images permits novel uses of the data and extends the possibilities for in vivo human neuroanatomy.},

The gating of these channels is determined by the asynchronous movements of four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs). Past studies on the skeletal muscle Nav1.4 channel have indicated that VSD-I, -II, and -III are sufficient for pore opening, whereas VSD-IV movement is sufficient for channel inactivation. Here, we studied the cardiac sodium channel, Nav1.5, using charge-neutralizing mutations and voltage-clamp fluorometry. Our results reveal that both VSD-III and -IV are necessary for Nav1.5 inactivation, and that steady-state inactivation can be modulated by all VSDs. We also demonstrate that channel activation is partially determined by VSD-IV movement. Kinetic modeling suggests that these observations can be explained from the cardiac channel’s propensity to enter closed-state inactivation (CSI), which is significantly higher than that of other Nav channels. We show that skeletal muscle Nav1.4, cardiac Nav1.5, and neuronal Nav1.6 all have different propensities for CSI and postulate that these differences produce isoform-dependent roles for the four VSDs.}",

abstract = {A sodium channel is composed of four similar domains, each containing a highly charged S4 helix that is driven outward (activates) in response to a depolarization. Functionally, the channel has two gates, called activation gate (a gate) and inactivation gate (I gate), both of which must be open for conduction to occur. The cytoplasmically located a gate opens after a depolarization has activated the S4s of (probably) all four domains. The I gate consists of a cytoplasmically located inactivation “particle” and a receptor for it in the channel. The receptor becomes available after some degree of S4 activation, and the particle diffuses in to inactivate the channel. The I gate usually closes when the a gate is open [open-state inactivation (Osi)] but also can close before the channel reaches the conducting state. This “closed-state inactivation” (Csi) is studied quantitatively in this paper to determine the degree of S4 activation required for (i) opening the a gate, and (ii) permitting the I gate to close. Csi is most prominent for small depolarizations, during which occupancy of the partially activated closed states is prolonged. Large depolarizations drive the S4s outward quickly, minimizing the duration of closed-state occupancy and making Csi small and Osi large. Based on these data and evidence in the literature, it is concluded that opening the a gate requires S4 activation in domains 1–3, with partial activation of the S4 of domain 4. Csi requires only S4 activation of domains 3 and 4, which does not open the a gate.}}

abstract = {Eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels contribute to the rising phase of  action potentials and served as an early muse for biophysicists laying the foundation for our current understanding of electrical signaling. Given their central role in electrical excitability, it is not surprising that (a) inherited mutations in genes encoding for Nav channels and their accessory subunits have been linked to excitability disorders in brain, muscle, and heart; and (b) Nav channels are targeted by various drugs and naturally occurring toxins. Although the overall architecture and behavior of these channels are likely to be similar to the more well-studied voltage-gated potassium channels, eukaryotic Nav channels lack structural and functional symmetry, a notable difference that has implications for gating and selectivity. Activation of voltage-sensing modules of the first three domains in Nav channels is sufficient to open the channel pore, whereas movement of the domain IV voltage sensor is correlated with inactivation. Also, structure-function studies of eukaryotic Nav channels show that a set of amino acids in the selectivity filter, referred to as DEKA locus, is essential for Na(+) selectivity. Structures of prokaryotic Nav channels have also shed new light on mechanisms of drug block. These structures exhibit lateral fenestrations that are large enough to allow drugs or lipophilic molecules to gain access into the inner vestibule, suggesting that this might be the passage for drug entry into a closed channel. In this Review, we will synthesize our current understanding of Nav channel gating mechanisms, ion selectivity and permeation, and modulation by therapeutics and toxins in light of the new structures of the prokaryotic Nav channels that, for the time being, serve as structural models of their eukaryotic counterparts.},

Auxiliary subunits, β1-β4, are thought to regulate Nav channel function through covalent and/or polar interactions with the channel{\textquoteright} s voltage-sensing domains. How these interactions translate into the diverse and variable regulatory effects of β-subunits remains unclear. Here, we find that the intrinsic movement order of the voltage-sensing domains during channel gating is unexpectedly variable across Nav channel isoforms. This movement order dictates the channel{\textquoteright} s propensity for closed-state inactivation, which in turn modulates the actions of β1 and β3. We show that the differential regulation of skeletal muscle, cardiac, and neuronal Nav channels is explained by their variable levels of closed-state inactivation. Together, this study provides a unified mechanism for the regulation of all Nav channel isoforms by β1 and β3, which explains how the fixed structural interactions of auxiliary subunits can paradoxically exert variable effects on channel function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {The human brain is often considered to be the most cognitively capable among mammalian brains and to be much larger than expected for a mammal of our body size. Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human‐sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 ± 8.1 billion NeuN‐positive cells (“neurons”) and 84.6 ± 9.8 billion NeuN‐negative (“nonneuronal”) cells. With only 19% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled‐up primate brain.

abstract = {Although extracellular unit recording is typically used for the detection of spike occurrences, it also has the theoretical ability to report about what are typically considered intracellular features of the action potential. We address this theoretical ability by developing a model system that captures features of experimentally recorded simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We use the line source approximation method of Holt and Koch to model the extracellular action potential (EAP) voltage resulting from the spiking activity of individual neurons. We compare the simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo with model predictions for the same cells reconstructed and simulated with compartmental models. The model accurately reproduces both the waveform and the amplitude of the EAPs, although it was difficult to achieve simultaneous good matches on both the intracellular and extracellular waveforms. This suggests that accounting for the EAP waveform provides a considerable constraint on the overall model. The developed model explains how and why the waveform varies with electrode position relative to the recorded cell. Interestingly, each cell's dendritic morphology had very little impact on the EAP waveform. The model also demonstrates that the varied composition of ionic currents in different cells is reflected in the features of the EAP.},

The elementary generators of the EEG are relatively small patches of the cell membrane, including several synapses and some passive membrane through which the synaptic current returns into the cell. However, there is still no definitive evidence as to the approximate size of such unitary generators and their relative distribution on the cell body and dendrites. An analysis of the relationships between the gross EEG and the wave activity of individual nerve cells is presented in the chapter. The analysis indicates that the gross activity is produced through summation of the synchronized activity of a comparatively small fraction of the cerebral neuronal population. Although the rest of the population also is active, their contributions are not synchronized and summate much less effectively, not reaching the limit of resolution of EEG recorders. Implications for computer analysis of EEG data are presented in the chapter.},

abstract = {Neocortical neurons in vivo are subjected to intense synaptic bombardment, leading to a 'high-conductance state' that differs markedly from the conditions measured in cortical slices in vitro.During barbiturate anaesthesia, as well as in slices, neuronal activity is greatly reduced compared with states of activated or desynchronized electroencephalogram (EEG) activity, such as in awake animals. During EEG-activated states, intracellular recordings show a depolarized and fluctuating membrane potential, a low input resistance and high levels of spontaneous firing. In slices, cells have a high input resistance, are hyperpolarized and show little spontaneous activity.Active dendritic properties such as the ability to generate and propagate action potentials have important implications for the integration of synaptic inputs. Computational models have been used to investigate these implications for in vivo processing.These models predict the following 'computational principles' for high-conductance states: enhanced responsiveness and gain modulation; equalization of synaptic efficacies; increased temporal resolution; and probabilistic and irregular behaviour. By virtue of these principles, cortical neurons would be tuned to optimally track fine temporal variations in their synaptic inputs despite their stochastic nature.In dynamic-clamp experiments, in vitro electrophysiology is combined with computational modelling to 'recreate' the characteristics of high-conductance states in cortical slices, allowing the effects of the high-conductance state on neuronal responsiveness to be measured directly.Such experiments confirm that synaptic noise enhances neuronal responsiveness and modulates the gain of neurons. They could also be used to test the predictions that it equalizes synaptic efficacies, increases temporal resolution and induces probabilistic behaviour.},

Neuronal excitation is unexpected in the presence of this GABAA-potentiating drug. We construct a series of network models to understand this paradox. Individual neurons have ion channel conductances with Hodgkin–Huxley-type formulations. Propofol increases the maximal conductance and time constant of decay of the synaptic GABAA current. Networks range in size from 2 to 230 neurons. Population output is measured as a function of pyramidal cell activity, with the electroencephalogram approximated by the sum of population AMPA activity between pyramidal cells. These model networks suggest propofol-induced paradoxical excitation may result from a membrane level interaction between the GABAA current and an intrinsic membrane slow potassium current (M-current). This membrane level interaction has consequences at the level of multicellular networks enabling a switch from baseline interneuron synchrony to propofol-induced interneuron antisynchrony. Large network models reproduce the clinical EEG changes characteristic of propofol-induced paradoxical excitation. The EEG changes coincide with the emergence of antisynchronous interneuron clusters in the model networks. Our findings suggest interneuron antisynchrony as a potential network mechanism underlying the generation of propofol-induced paradoxical excitation. As correlates of behavioral phenomenology, these networks may refine our understanding of the specific behavioral states associated with general anesthesia.},

Stability analysis of the linearized model and simulations of different degrees of complexity show that stability is only obtained for very fast and sufficiently strong inhibition; otherwise the network activity develops into synchronous oscillations with frequency and amplitude dynamics governed predominantly by the inhibition parameters, but largely independent of (1) the network architecture (uniform, random or structured), (2) the spiking or analog nature of the neural activity, and, albeit to a lesser extent, (3) the linear or nonlinear nature of the neural threshold function. Provided the network connectivity is sufficiently rich and structured, the spike activity exhibits features which resemble those observed in physiological recordings from various cortical areas: cell assembly behaviour with different, simultaneous correlation dynamics (event coherence and rate coherence).},

abstract = {Although slow waves of the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been associated with attentional processes, the functional significance of the alpha component in the EEG (8.1–12 Hz) remains uncertain. Conventionally, synchronisation in the alpha frequency range is taken to be a marker of cognitive inactivity, i.e. ‘cortical idling'. However, it has been suggested that alpha may index the active inhibition of sensory information during internally directed attentional tasks such as mental imagery. More recently, this idea has been amended to encompass the notion of alpha synchronisation as a means of inhibition of non-task relevant cortical areas irrespective of the direction of attention. Here we test the adequacy of the one idling and two inhibition hypotheses about alpha. In two experiments we investigated the relation between alpha and internally vs. externally directed attention using mental imagery vs. sensory-intake paradigms. Results from both experiments showed a clear relationship between alpha and both attentional factors and increased task demands. At various scalp sites alpha amplitudes were greater during internally directed attention and during increased load, results incompatible with alpha reflecting cortical idling and more in keeping with suggestions of active inhibition necessary for internally driven mental operations.},

Each anesthetic drug class produces distinct oscillatory dynamics that can be related to the circuit mechanisms of drug action. Sleep is a naturally occurring state of decreased arousal that is essential for normal health. Physiological measurements (electrooculogram, electromyogram) and neural oscillatory (electroencephalogram) dynamics are used to empirically characterize sleep into rapid eye movement sleep and the three stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep.

It was discovered that movements might occur without a change of state and a change of state without movement, but frequently movement was immediately followed by a change of state upward, occasionally downward, and occasionally a movement occurred just after a change of state. During sleep there was a continual shift in states upward and downward, sometimes associated with recognized stimuli, sometimes without any external stimulus but probably as a result of internal stimuli. Stimuli shift the level upward, sometimes skipping one or two states but not necessarily awakening the sleeper. In two instances dreams occurred in the B state.

abstract = {1. Electrophysiologically identified thalamocortical neurones have been intra- and extracellularly recorded in acutely prepared cats, under different anaesthetic conditions. 2. A slow (0.5-4 Hz) membrane potential oscillation was observed in thalamocortical cells recorded in motor, sensory, associational and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. The oscillation consisted of rhythmic low-threshold spikes alternating with after-hyperpolarizations. 3. About 80% of the neurones with intact cortical connections were set into the slow oscillatory mode by bringing their membrane potential to between -68 and -90 mV. The oscillation did not depend upon the occurrence of fast action potentials and did not outlast the imposed hyperpolarization. 4. Anatomical or functional disconnection from related cortical areas resulted in a membrane potential hyperpolarization of about 9 mV and in the occurrence of spontaneous slow oscillations in virtually all recorded neurones. The intrinsic nature of the phenomenon was supported by the lack of rhythmic postsynaptic potentials as the cells were prevented from oscillating by outward current injection. 5. In contrast with other thalamic nuclei, the slow oscillation has not been observed in anterior thalamic neurones despite their having similar basic electrophysiological properties. 6. Barbiturate administration suppressed the slow oscillatory mode, an effect accompanied by a decrease in the membrane input resistance. 7. Multiunit recordings of spontaneously oscillating cells showed epochs characterized by phase-related firing. This synchronous discharge was paralleled by a clear-cut build-up of field potentials in the frequency range of electroencephalogram slow or delta waves. 8. These results demonstrate that the majority of thalamocortical neurones are endowed with electrophysiological properties allowing them to oscillate at 0.5-4 Hz, if they have a membrane potential more negative than -65 mV and a high input resistance. Such a condition is physiologically achieved in the deepest stages of electroencephalogram-synchronized sleep, as a result of brain stem-thalamic as well as cortico-thalamic deafferentation. We postulate a thalamic contribution in the genesis of electroencephalogram delta waves during slow wave sleep, once independently oscillating thalamocortical cells become in phase.},

@article{Steriade1991,
abstract = {A slow (0.5-4 Hz) oscillation of thalamic neurons was recently described and attributed to the interplay of two intrinsic currents. In this study, we investigated the network modulation of this intrinsic thalamic oscillation within the frequency range of EEG sleep $\delta$-waves. We performed intracellular and extracellular recordings of antidromically identified thalamocortical cells (n = 305) in sensory, motor, associational, and intralaminar nuclei of anesthetized cats. At the resting membrane potential, V(m) (-60.3 ± 0.4 mV, mean ± SE), cortical stimulation induced spindle-like oscillations (7-14 Hz), whereas at V(m) more negative than -65 mV the same stimuli triggered an oscillation within the EEG $\delta$-frequency (0.5-4 Hz), consisting of low-threshold spikes (LTSs) followed by afterhyperpolarizing potentials (AHPs). The LTS-AHP sequences outlasted cortical stimuli as a self-sustained rhythmicity at 1-2 Hz. Corticothalamic stimuli were able to transform subthreshold slow (0.5-4 Hz) oscillations, occurring spontaneously at V(m) more negative than -65 mV, into rhythmic LTSs crowned by bursts of Na+ spikes that persisted for 10-20 sec after cessation of cortical volleys. Cortical volleys also revived a hyperpolarization-activated slow oscillation when it dampened after a few cycles. Auto- and crosscorrelograms of neuronal pairs revealed that unrelated cells became synchronized after a series of corticothalamic stimuli, with both neurons displaying rhythmic (1-2 Hz) bursts or spike trains. Since $\delta$-thalamic oscillations, prevailing during late sleep stages, are triggered at more negative V(m) than spindles characterizing the early sleep stage, we postulate a progressive hyperpolarization of thalamocortical neurons with the deepening of the behavioral state of EEG-synchronized sleep. In view of the evidence that cortical-elicited slow oscillations depend on synaptically induced hyperpolarization of thalamocortical cells, we propose that the potentiating influence of the corticothalamic input results from the engagement of two GABAergic thalamic cell classes, reticular and local-circuit neurons. The thalamocorticothalamic loop would transfer the spike bursts of thalamic oscillating cells to cortical targets, which in turn would reinforce the oscillation by direct pathways and/or indirect projections relayed by reticular and local-circuit thalamic cells. Stimulation of mesopontine cholinergic [peribrachial (PB) and laterodorsal tegmental (LDT)] nuclei in monoamine-depleted animals had an effect that was opposite to that exerted by corticothalamic volleys. PB/LDT stimulation reduced or suppressed the slow (1-4 Hz) oscillatory bursts of high-frequency spikes in thalamic cells. The PB/LDT effect was associated with depolarization of thalamocortical neurons and EEG activation. The cortical EEG response included the appearance of 40 Hz cortical waves. The short-lasting effect of PB/LDT stimulation lasted for 2-3 sec, was accompanied by increased membrane conductance, and was blocked by the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine. Less often, the PB/LDT-induced disruption of the slow oscillation lasted for 10-15 sec. Similarly to the effect exerted by PB/LDT stimulation, the slow oscillation of bursting neurons recorded from the dorsal lateral geniculate neurons was suppressed and replaced by tonic firing as a result of photic stimulation. Our results demonstrate that diffusely projecting modulatory systems or sensory-specific channels that succeed in depolarizing target thalamic cells decouple synchronized neurons, disrupt the slow oscillation, and prepare thalamocortical cells to transfer incoming signals. These data indicate that, while the slow oscillation of individual thalamic neurons results from the interplay of their intrinsic currents, the synchronization of neuronal ensembles and, as a consequence, the genesis of macroscopic rhythmic EEG potentials, depend on the properties of thalamocortical networks including inhibitory thalamic cells. The suppression of $\delta$-oscillation with transition from slow-wave sleep to either arousal or rapid-eye-movement sleep is largely due to brainstem-thalamic cholinergic modulation acting diffusely on thalamocortical systems.},

abstract = {The transition from wakefulness to NREM sleep is associated with typical signs of  brain electrical activity, characterized by prolonged periods of hyperpolarization and increased membrane conductance in thalamocortical (TC) neurons, with the consequence that incoming messages are inhibited and the cerebral cortex is deprived of signals from the outside world. There are three major oscillations during NREM sleep. Spindles are generated within the thalamus, due to thalamic reticular (RE) neurons that impose rhythmic inhibitory sequences onto TC neurons, but the widespread synchronization of this rhythm is governed by corticothalamic projections. There are two types of delta activity: clock-like waves generated in TC neurons by the interplay between two hyperpolarization-activated inward currents; and cortical waves that survive extensive thalamectomy. The hallmark of NREM sleep activity is the slow oscillation, generated intracortically, which has the virtue of grouping the other types of sleep activities, thus leading to a coalescence of different rhythms that can only be observed in intact-brain animals and humans. Far from being epiphenomena, with no functional role, NREM sleep oscillations, particularly spindles and their experimental model augmenting responses, produce synaptic plasticity in target cortical neurons and resonant activity in corticothalamic loops, as in "memory" processes. Upon brain arousal, spindles are blocked by inhibition of RE neurons, the spindles' pacemakers; clock-like delta rhythm is obliterated by depolarization of TC neurons; and the cortically generated slow oscillation is abolished by selective erasure of its hyperpolarizing components. Fast (beta and gamma) oscillations are roduced by the depolarizing effects of mesopontine cholinergic neurons acting on TC neurons and nucleus basalis neurons acting on cortical neurons.},

abstract = {Recent studies have disclosed several oscillations occurring during resting sleep within the frequency range of the classical delta band (0.5–4 Hz). There are at least 3 oscillations with distinct mechanisms and sites of origin: a slow (<1 Hz) cortically-generated oscillation, a clock-like thalamic oscillation (1–4 Hz), and a cortical oscillation (1–4 Hz). The present paper reviews data on these oscillations and the possible mechanisms which coalesce them into the polymorphic waves of slow wave sleep. Data stem from intracellular (over 500 single cell and 50 double impalements) and field potentials recorded from the cortex and thalamus of cats (120 animals) under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia. Other experiments were based on whole night EEG recordings from humans (5 subjects). The frequency of the slow oscillation both in anesthetized animals and in naturally sleeping humans ranged between 0.1 and 1 Hz (89% of the cases being between 0.5 and 0.9 Hz). The slow (<1 Hz) oscillation is reflected in the EEG as rhythmic sequences of surface-negative waves (associated with hyperpolarizations of deeply-lying neurons) and surface-positive K-complexes (representing excitation in large pools of cortical neurons). Through its long-range synchronization, the slow oscillation has the ability to trigger and to group thalamically-generated spindles and two delta (1–4 Hz) oscillations. Finally, it is argued that the analysis of the electroencephalogram should transcend the spectral analyses, by taking into account the shape of the waves and, when possible, the basic mechanisms that generate those waves.},

abstract = {1. The physiological and functional features of time-dependent anomalous rectification activated by hyperpolarization and the current which underlies it, Ih, were examined in guinea-pig and cat thalamocortical relay neurones using in vitro intracellular recording techniques in thalamic slices. 2. Hyperpolarization of the membrane from rest with a constant-current pulse resulted in time-dependent rectification, expressed as a depolarizing sag of the membrane potential back towards rest. Under voltage clamp conditions, hyperpolarizing steps to membrane potentials negative to approximately -60 mV were associated with the activation of a slow inward current, Ih, which showed no inactivation with time. 3. The activation curve of the conductance underlying Ih was obtained through analysis of tail currents and ranged from -60 to -90 mV, with half-activation occurring at -75 mV. The time course of activation of Ih was well fitted by a single-exponential function and was strongly voltage dependent, with time constants ranging from greater than 1-2 s at threshold to an average of 229 ms at -95 mV. The time course of de-activation was also described by a single-exponential function, was voltage dependent, and the time constant ranged from an average of 1000 ms at -80 mV to 347 ms at -55 mV. 4. Raising [K+]o from 2.5 to 7.5 mM enhanced, while decreasing [Na+]o from 153 to 26 mM reduced, the amplitude of Ih. In addition, reduction of [Na+]o slowed the rate of Ih activation. These results indicate that Ih is carried by both Na+ and K+ ions, which is consistent with the extrapolated reversal potential of -43 mV. Replacement of Cl- in the bathing medium with isethionate shifted the chloride equilibrium potential positive by approximately 30-70 mV, evoked an inward shift of the holding current at -50 mV, and resulted in a marked reduction of instantaneous currents as well as Ih, suggesting a non-specific blocking action of impermeable anions. 5. Local (2-10 mM in micropipette) or bath (1-2 mM) applications of Cs+ abolished Ih over the whole voltage range tested (-60 to -110 mV), with no consistent effects on instantaneous currents. Barium (1 mM, local; 0.3-0.5 mM, bath) evoked a steady inward current, reduced the amplitude of instantaneous currents, and had only weak suppressive effects on Ih. 6. Block of Ih with local application of Cs+ resulted in a hyperpolarization of the membrane from the resting level, a decrease in apparent membrane conductance, and a block of the slow after-hyperpolarization that appears upon termination of depolarizing membrane responses, indicating that Ih contributes substantially to the resting and active membrane properties of thalamocortical relay neurones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

From a holding potential of -50 mV, voltage steps negative to -60 mV showed the presence of a slow, non-inactivating inward current, Ih. This current was unaffected by Ba2+ (1-4 mM), tetrodotoxin (0.5-1 microM) and TEA (20 mM, n = 6), reversibly blocked by Cs+ (1-3 mM), and its reversal potential (-33.0 +/- 1.2 mV) followed changes in the extracellular Na+ and K+, but not Cl-, concentration. 3. Application of Cs+ (1-3 mM) abolished the pacemaker oscillations (n = 9), while in six cells that did not show any oscillatory activity Cs+ first evoked the spindle-like oscillations that, in the continuous presence of these ions, were then transformed into the pacemaker oscillations before all activities were finally blocked: all these effects were accompanied by a hyperpolarization and a progressive decrease and final blockade of Ih. Cs+ had no effect on the ?N-methyl-D-aspartate? (NMDA) oscillations (n = 5) and Ba2+ (2 mM, n = 8) did not block the pacemaker, the spindle-like and the ?NMDA? oscillations. 4. In ten cells that showed the pacemaker oscillations selective activation of beta-adrenoceptors by 10-50 microM-noradrenaline (in the presence of alpha-noradrenergic antagonists) or by 20 microM-isoprenaline first transformed the pacemaker oscillations into the spindle-like oscillations that, in the continuous activation of beta-receptors, were finally abolished: all these effects were accompanied by a depolarization and a progressive increase of Ih. 5. In TC cells that showed the pacemaker oscillations application of 1-octanol (50-100 microM), an antagonist of T-type Ca2+ currents, reversibly blocked this activity but concomitantly decreased (50%) the cell input resistance (n = 5). Application of Ni2+ (0.2-0.5 mM, n = 13), another antagonist of IT reversibly blocked the pacemaker, the spindle-like and the ?NMDA? oscillations. 7.

The empiric approach has produced clinically useful drugs but for no drug is the mechanism of action completely understood. All available sedative/hypnotic medications have unwanted side effects and none of these medications creates a sleep architecture that is identical to the architecture of naturally occurring sleep. This chapter reviews recent advances in research aiming to elucidate the neurochemical mechanisms regulating sleep and wakefulness. One promise of rational drug design is that understanding the mechanisms of sedative/hypnotic action will significantly enhance drug safety and efficacy.},

Furthermore, it appeared from his records that regular rhythms of the same frequency (the 10 cycle alpha rhythm and the beta rhythms of from 25 to 50 per second) are obtained simultaneously from various parts of the head in normal persons; he therefore concluded that the entire brain or any particular region presents one type of bio-electric activity.T{\"{o}}nnies,2 Adrian and},

Traditionally associated with sensorimotor functions, beta oscillations have recently become more broadly implicated in top-down processing, long-range communication, and preservation of the current brain state. Here, we extend and refine these views based on accumulating new findings of content-specific beta-synchronization during endogenous information processing in working memory (WM) and decision making. We characterize such content-specific beta activity as short-lived, flexible network dynamics supporting the endogenous (re)activation of cortical representations. Specifically, we suggest that beta-mediated ensemble formation within and between cortical areas may awake, rather than merely preserve, an endogenous cognitive set in the service of current task demands. This proposal accommodates key aspects of content-specific beta modulations in monkeys and humans, integrates with timely computational models, and outlines a functional role for beta that fits its transient temporal characteristics.},

abstract = {The cellular generation and spatial distribution of gamma frequency (40– 100 Hz) activity was examined in the hippocampus of the awake rat. Field potentials and unit activity were recorded by multiple site silicon probes (5- and 16-site shanks) and wire electrode arrays. Gamma waves were highly coherent along the long axis of the dentate hilus, but average coherence decreased rapidly in the CA3 and CA1 directions. Analysis of short epochs revealed large fluctuations in coherence values between the dentate and CA1 gamma waves. Current source density analysis revealed large sinks and sources in the dentate gyrus with spatial distribution similar to the dipoles evoked by stimulation of the perforant path. The frequency changes of gamma and theta waves positively correlated (40–100 Hz and 5–10 Hz, respectively). Putative interneurons in the dentate gyrus discharged at gamma frequency and were phase-locked to the ascending part of the gamma waves recorded from the hilus. Following bilateral lesion of the entorhinal cortex the power and frequency of hilar gamma activity significantly decreased or disappeared. Instead, a large amplitude but slower gamma pattern (25–50 Hz) emerged in the CA3-CA1 network. We suggest that gamma oscillation emerges from an interaction between intrinsic oscillatory properties of interneurons and the network properties of the dentate gyrus. We also hypothesize that under physiological conditions the hilar gamma oscillation may be entrained by the entorhinal rhythm and that gamma oscillation in the CA3-CA1 circuitry is suppressed by either the hilar region or the entorhinal cortex.},

The amplitude of the local field-potential oscillations are maximal in response to stimuli that match the orientation and direction preference of the local cluster of neurons. Single and multiunit recordings from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus showed no evidence of oscillations of the neuronal firing probability in the range of 20-70 Hz. The results demonstrate that local neuronal populations in the visual cortex engage in stimulus-specific synchronous oscillations resulting from an intracortical mechanism. The oscillatory responses may provide a general mechanism by which activity patterns in spatially separate regions of the cortex are temporally coordinated.},

These network inhibitory postsynaptic potential oscillations occur in response to the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. The oscillations can entrain pyramidal cell discharges. The oscillation frequency is determined both by the net excitation of interneurons and by the kinetics of the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials between them.

These oscillations are thought to be important for information processing.Gamma oscillations can be replicated in in vitro models, in which the underlying mechanisms can be analysed systematically.In all in vitro models, gamma oscillations are dependent on GABAA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A)-receptor-mediated inhibition, suggesting that these oscillations are primarily generated by networks of inhibitory interneurons.Fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing basket cells are key components of the hippocampal interneuron network. They are extensively interconnected and fire action potentials that are phase-locked to the oscillations.Interneuron network models that are based on mutual inhibition, assuming slow, weak and hyperpolarizing synapses, generate synchronized gamma activity if exposed to a tonic excitatory drive. However, these models are highly sensitive to heterogeneity in the drive.Experimental analysis has revealed that basket cell–basket cell synapses are functionally specialized. They mediate fast, strong and shunting inhibition.Realistic interneuron network models generate synchronized gamma activity with increased robustness against heterogeneity in the tonic excitatory drive.Experimental analysis further reveals that basket cells are rapidly excited through gap junctions and fast glutamatergic synapses.Both gap junctions and fast glutamatergic synapses stabilize gamma activity in interneuron networks.Specialized synaptic properties turn the interneuron network into a robust gamma frequency oscillator. Therefore, interneuron networks might provide a precise reference signal for temporal encoding of information in principal neurons.},

abstract = {Fast neuronal oscillations (gamma, 20–80 Hz) have been observed in the neocortex and hippocampus during behavioral arousal. Using computer simulations, we investigated the hypothesis that such rhythmic activity can emerge in a random network of interconnected GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. Specific conditions for the population synchronization, on properties of single cells and the circuit, were identified. These include the following: (1) that the amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization be above the GABAA synaptic reversal potential; (2) that the ratio between the synaptic decay time constant and the oscillation period be sufficiently large; (3) that the effects of heterogeneities be modest because of a steep frequency–current relationship of fast-spiking neurons. Furthermore, using a population coherence measure, based on coincident firings of neural pairs, it is demonstrated that large-scale network synchronization requires a critical (minimal) average number of synaptic contacts per cell, which is not sensitive to the network size.By changing the GABAA synaptic maximal conductance, synaptic decay time constant, or the mean external excitatory drive to the network, the neuronal firing frequencies were gradually and monotonically varied. By contrast, the network synchronization was found to be high only within a frequency band coinciding with the gamma (20–80 Hz) range. We conclude that the GABAA synaptic transmission provides a suitable mechanism for synchronized gamma oscillations in a sparsely connected network of fast-spiking interneurons. In turn, the interneuronal network can presumably maintain subthreshold oscillations in principal cell populations and serve to synchronize discharges of spatially distributed neurons.},

abstract = {In model networks of E-cells and I-cells (excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively), synchronous rhythmic spiking often comes about from the interplay between the two cell groups: the E-cells synchronize the I-cells and vice versa. Under ideal conditions—homogeneity in relevant network parameters and all-to-all connectivity, for instance—this mechanism can yield perfect synchronization. We find that approximate, imperfect synchronization is possible even with very sparse, random connectivity. The crucial quantity is the expected number of inputs per cell. As long as it is large enough (more precisely, as long as the variance of the total number of synaptic inputs per cell is small enough), tight synchronization is possible. The desynchronizing effect of random connectivity can be reduced by strengthening the E→I synapses. More surprising, it cannot be reduced by strengthening the I→E synapses. However, the decay time constant of inhibition plays an important role. Faster decay yields tighter synchrony. In particular, in models in which the inhibitory synapses are assumed to be instantaneous, the effects of sparse, random connectivity cannot be seen.},

There are different classes of iGluRs with a variety of receptor subtypes in each class that play distinct roles in neuronal functions. The diversity in iGluR subtypes, with their unique functional properties and physiologic roles, has motivated a large number of studies. Our understanding of receptor subtypes has advanced considerably since the first iGluR subunit gene was cloned in 1989, and the research focus has expanded to encompass facets of biology that have been recently discovered and to exploit experimental paradigms made possible by technological advances. Here, we review insights from more than 3 decades of iGluR studies with an emphasis on the progress that has occurred in the past decade. We cover structure, function, pharmacology, roles in neurophysiology, and therapeutic implications for all classes of receptors assembled from the subunits encoded by the 18 ionotropic glutamate receptor genes.Significance Statement Glutamate receptors play important roles in virtually all aspects of brain function and are either involved in mediating some clinical features of neurological disease or represent a therapeutic target for treatment. Therefore, understanding the structure, function, and pharmacology of this class of receptors will advance our understanding of many aspects of brain function at molecular, cellular, and system levels and provide new opportunities to treat patients.},

The time course of free glutamate in the cleft was estimated by kinetic analysis of the displacement of a rapidly dissociating competitive antagonist from N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors during synaptic transmission. Glutamate peaked at 1.1 millimolar and decayed with a time constant of 1.2 milliseconds at cultured hippocampal synapses. This time course implies that transmitter saturates postsynaptic NMDA receptors. However, glutamate dissociates much more rapidly from $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Thus, the time course of free glutamate predicts that dissociation contributes to the decay of the AMPA receptor-mediated postsynaptic current.},

abstract = {We have identified an excitatory synapse in cerebellar molecular layer interneurons at which the level of presynaptic activity determines the receptor type involved in the postsynaptic response. When small numbers of parallel fibers are activated, EPSCs are mediated solely by AMPA receptors (AMPARs), despite our finding that NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are present in the dendrites of these cells. The EPSC kinetics are fast ($\tau$ decay = 0.82 ± 0.05 msec at room temperature), consistent with the role these interneurons are thought to play in precisely timed inhibitory control of Purkinje cells. NMDARs are activated only when glutamate release is increased either by facilitation with brief high-frequency trains or by recruiting more presynaptic fibers with higher stimulus intensities. Under these conditions, EPSCs consist of a fast-rising AMPAR-mediated current followed by a slow component mediated by both NMDARs and AMPARs. Inhibitors of glutamate transport increase the amplitude and prolong the time course of the compound EPSCs. In contrast, the properties of fast AMPAR EPSCs resulting from the activation of few inputs remain unchanged when glutamate uptake is blocked. Our results suggest that, at these synapses, the postsynaptic density contains AMPARs alone. It is only when transmitter release is high enough for glutamate to diffuse to the extrasynaptic space and to reach concentrations sufficient to activate extrasynaptic receptors that NMDARs are involved in the postsynaptic response. We suggest that such a spatial separation of receptor types may provide a mechanism for rapid changes in EPSC properties, depending on the amount of synaptic activity.},

The kinetic and conductance properties of AMPARs are laid down during their biogenesis and are regulated by post-transcriptional RNA editing, splice variation, post-translational modification, and subunit composition. Furthermore, AMPAR assembly, trafficking, and functional heterogeneity depends on a large repertoire of auxiliary subunits—a feature that is particularly striking for this type of iGluR.

abstract = {Abstract During the past decade, considerable evidence has accumulated that non-NMDA glutamate receptors (both AMPA and kainate subtypes) are modulated by the association of the core tetrameric receptor with auxiliary proteins that are integral components of native receptor assemblies. This short review focuses on the effect of two types of auxiliary subunits on the biophysical properties and kinetic behaviour of AMPA and kainate receptors at the level of single receptor molecules. Type I transmembrane AMPA receptor proteins increase the number of AMPA receptor openings that result from a single receptor activation as well as the proportion of openings to conductance levels above 30 pS, resulting in larger peak ensemble currents that decay more slowly and bi?exponentially. Co-expression of Neto1 and 2 with pore-forming kainate receptor subunits also increases the duration of bursts and destabilizes desensitized states, resulting in a rapid component of recovery and clusters of bursts that produce a slow component in desensitization decays. The distinct gating seen in the presence of auxiliary subunits reflects slow switching between gating modes with different single-channel kinetics and open probability. At any given time, the relative proportions of receptors in each gating mode determine both the shape and the amplitude of synaptic currents.},
