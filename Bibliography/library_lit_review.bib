    abstract = "{Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels produce the upstroke of action potentials in excitable tissues throughout the body. The gating of these channels is determined by the asynchronous movements of four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs). Past studies on the skeletal muscle Nav1.4 channel have indicated that VSD-I, -II, and -III are sufficient for pore opening, whereas VSD-IV movement is sufficient for channel inactivation. Here, we studied the cardiac sodium channel, Nav1.5, using charge-neutralizing mutations and voltage-clamp fluorometry. Our results reveal that both VSD-III and -IV are necessary for Nav1.5 inactivation, and that steady-state inactivation can be modulated by all VSDs. We also demonstrate that channel activation is partially determined by VSD-IV movement. Kinetic modeling suggests that these observations can be explained from the cardiac channel’s propensity to enter closed-state inactivation (CSI), which is significantly higher than that of other Nav channels. We show that skeletal muscle Nav1.4, cardiac Nav1.5, and neuronal Nav1.6 all have different propensities for CSI and postulate that these differences produce isoform-dependent roles for the four VSDs.}",

@article{Alger1979,
abstract = {$\gamma$-Amlnobutyric acid (GABA) can have a biphasic effect on membrane potential when applied to certain central nervous system neurones1–3. Typically with iontophoresis, this effect is a negative–positive sequence of deflections and both phases are associated with an increase in conductance. However, iontophoretic application of neurotransmitter substances can produce effects even in cases where ordinary synaptic transmitter release is impossible; for example, on dorsal root ganglion cells. Thus, it is important in assessing the physiological relevance of the depolarising GABA response to determine if similar actions are produced synaptically. In addition, although the depolarising aspect of the GABA response has been attributed to activation of dendritic receptors, this identification has remained uncertain. Here, we have used the hippocampal slice preparation to demonstrate that a biphasic inhibitory response results from orthodromic, but not antidromic electrical stimulation in the presence of anaesthetic concentrations of pentobarbital. (For the sake of brevity, we use the term ‘biphasic inhibitory postynaptic potential (i.p.s.p.)' to describe the response complex, although it seems likely that a combination of two distinct events, rather than two parts of a single event, occurs.) GABA antagonists and tetrodotoxin (TTX) were used to show that the depolarising phase is due to synaptically released GABA acting on dendritic sites in the CA1 region. Both negative and positive phases are associated with a large conductance increase, and both block cell firing, indicating their inhibitory nature. The ionic mechanism of the depolarising phase is not fully understood but seems to involve a chloride conductance increase. Although the functional significance of the depolarising sign of the i.p.s.p. is not clear, the dendritic location would provide very effective control over dendritic excitability.},

@article{Andersen1980,
abstract = {1. Extra- and intracellular recordings were made from CA1 cells in hippocampal slices in vitro. The effects of ionophoretically applied GABA on somatic and dendritic regions were studied. 2. Ionophoresis of GABA at dendritic sites gave a reciprocal effect by inhibiting the effect of excitatory synapses close to the dendritic application, while facilitating those lying further away. For example, GABA delivered to the mid-radiatum dendritic region reduced the population spike generated by a radiatum volley, while facilitating the population spike evoked by oriens fibre stimulation. Similarly, when single cells were recorded from, mid-apical dendritic delivery of GABA abolished the synaptically driven discharges evoked by fibres terminating at this part of the dendritic tree, but facilitated the responses to input from fibres terminating on the basal dendrites of the same cell. 3. With intracellular recording two effects were observed. Applied near the soma, GABA induced a hyperpolarization associated with an increased membrane conductance. When applied to dendrites, GABA caused a depolarization also associated with an increased membrane conductance. Both types of GABA applications could inhibit cell discharges, although in some cases the depolarizing response could facilitate other excitatory influences or cause cell firing by itself. 4. Both the hyperpolarizing and depolarizing GABA responses persisted after blockade of synaptic transmission by applying a low calcium high magnesium solution, indicating mediation via a direct effect upon the cell membrane. 5. The reversal potential for the hyperpolarizing GABA effect was similar to the equilibrium potential for the i.p.s.p. evoked from alveus or orthodromically, and was 10-12 mV more negative than the resting potential. The size of the depolarizing response was also dependent upon the membrane potential. By extrapolation an estimated equilibrium potential was calculated as about -40 mV. 6. Our results support the idea that the hyperpolarizing basket cell inhibition at the soma is mediated by the release of GABA. This hyperpolarizing response causes a general inhibition of firing. The dendritic effects of GABA, however, seem to represent another type of inhibition, which by shunting synaptic currents makes possible a selective inhibitory influence on afferents synapsing locally while facilitating more remotely placed excitatory synapses. We propose the term discriminative inhibition for this postulated new type of control of pyramidal cell discharges.},

abstract = {Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) cation channels are encoded by HCN1-4 gene family and have four subtypes. These channels are activated upon hyperpolarization of membrane potential and conduct an inward, excitatory current Ih in the nervous system. Ih acts as pacemaker current to initiate rhythmic firing, dampen dendritic excitability and regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release. This review summarizes recent insights into the cellular functions of Ih and associated behavior such as learning and memory, sleep and arousal. HCN channels are excellent targets of various cellular signals to finely regulate neuronal responses to external stimuli. Numerous mechanisms, including transcriptional control, trafficking, as well as channel assembly and modiﬁcation, underlie HCN channel regulation. In the next section, we discuss how the intracellular signals, especially recent findings concerning protein kinases and interacting proteins such as cGKII, Ca2+/CaMKII and TRIP8b, regulate function and expression of HCN channels, and subsequently provide an overview of the effects of neurotransmitters on HCN channels and their corresponding intracellular mechanisms. We also discuss the dysregulation of HCN channels in pathological conditions. Finally, insight into future directions in this exciting area of ion channel research is provided.},

Intrinsic excitability is a dynamic process subject to multiple levels of regulation from channel gene expression to post-translational modifications that influence channel activity. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of some of the mechanisms by which channels can be modified in order to influence neuronal output. We focus on four levels of regulation: channel gene transcription, alternative splicing of channel transcripts, post-translational modifications that alter channel kinetics (phosphorylation), and subcellular localization and trafficking of channel proteins.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit extreme diversity in gene expression as well as in morphological and electrophysiological properties1,2. Most existing neural taxonomies are based on either transcriptomic3,4 or morpho-electric5,6 criteria, as it has been technically challenging to study both aspects of neuronal diversity in the same set of cells7. Here we used Patch-seq8 to combine patch-clamp recording, biocytin staining, and single-cell RNA sequencing of more than 1,300 neurons in adult mouse primary motor cortex, providing a morpho-electric annotation of almost all transcriptomically defined neural cell types. We found that, although broad families of transcriptomic types (those expressing Vip, Pvalb, Sst and so on) had distinct and essentially non-overlapping morpho-electric phenotypes, individual transcriptomic types within the same family were not well separated in the morpho-electric space. Instead, there was a continuum of variability in morphology and electrophysiology, with neighbouring transcriptomic cell types showing similar morpho-electric features, often without clear boundaries between them. Our results suggest that neuronal types in the neocortex do not always form discrete entities. Instead, neurons form a hierarchy that consists of distinct non-overlapping branches at the level of families, but can form continuous and correlated transcriptomic and morpho-electrical landscapes within families.},

abstract = {The neocortex is disproportionately expanded in human compared with mouse 1,2 , both in its total volume relative to subcortical structures and in the proportion occupied by supragranular layers composed of neurons that selectively make connections within the neocortex and with other telencephalic structures. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of human and mouse neocortex show an increased diversity of glutamatergic neuron types in supragranular layers in human neocortex and pronounced gradients as a function of cortical depth 3 . Here, to probe the functional and anatomical correlates of this transcriptomic diversity, we developed a robust platform combining patch clamp recording, biocytin staining and single-cell RNA-sequencing (Patch-seq) to examine neurosurgically resected human tissues. We demonstrate a strong correspondence between morphological, physiological and transcriptomic phenotypes of five human glutamatergic supragranular neuron types. These were enriched in but not restricted to layers, with one type varying continuously in all phenotypes across layers 2 and 3. The deep portion of layer 3 contained highly distinctive cell types, two of which express a neurofilament protein that labels long-range projection neurons in primates that are selectively depleted in Alzheimer's disease 4,5 . Together, these results demonstrate the explanatory power of transcriptomic cell-type classification, provide a structural underpinning for increased complexity of cortical function in humans, and implicate discrete transcriptomic neuron types as selectively vulnerable in disease.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated ion channels are targeted to precise locations in polarized neurons that affect the response of the neuron to electrical activity. Neurons can adjust channel activities by modifying channel properties or altering channel densities.In general, voltage-gated sodium (Nav) and voltage-gated potassium (Kv1 and KCNQ) channels are located in the axon, and Kv2, Kv4, and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCNs) are located in the dendrites. There are exceptions; for example, different types of voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels and Kv3 channels are distributed in the axon and dendrites.Mechanisms of directed targeting, transcytosis, and selective retention or endocytosis have been proposed for axonal targeting of proteins of the neuronal membrane. A mechanism of selective endocytosis has been proposed for Nav channels.Various structural motifs physically link channels to proteins that can cluster or anchor themselves at the membrane, target channels to their proper neuronal location, or affect the forward trafficking or endocytosis of these channels.Myelin is involved in the clustering of Nav and Kv channels to the nodes of Ranvier by an as-yet-unidentified factor.},
