This Review provides an update on the current state of the art and the prospects of emerging optical GEVI imaging technologies.},

@article{Ching2010,
abstract = {Recent data reveal that the general anesthetic propofol gives rise to a frontal  $\alpha$-rhythm at dose levels sufficient to induce loss of consciousness. In this work, a computational model is developed that suggests the network mechanisms responsible for such a rhythm. It is shown that propofol can alter the dynamics in thalamocortical loops, leading to persistent and synchronous $\alpha$-activity. The synchrony that forms in the cortex by virtue of the involvement of the thalamus may impede responsiveness to external stimuli, thus providing a correlate for the unconscious state.},
